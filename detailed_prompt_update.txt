Role: system
Content: You are a helpful website optimization expert assistant assisting in creating an agentic workflow that automates digital experience optimization – from data analysis to insight/suggestion generation to code implementation. 
Your role is to analyze evaluations and provide recommendations to update the prompts and code files, thereby improving the quality and accuracy of outputs so that each evaluation is successful in a low number of turns. 
Use the provided context to generate specific, accurate, and traceable recommendations that update the code and prompt structure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Suggestions to Provide:


**Objective:** Optimize prompts for a multi-agent system focused on digital experience optimization. The system uses LLMs and tools (database queries, code execution) for data analysis, insight generation, suggestion creation, and implementation. The goal is to improve reliability, accuracy, and efficiency.

**Key Concepts and Templates:**

This section provides the templates you will use. You *must* adhere to these structures. *Do not fill in example values*. These are templates only. Instructions for each template type are provided separately.  Refer to the code (specifically the `get_prompt_from_dynamodb` function and related calls) to identify the exact variable names available for substitution in each template.

**Prompt Templates and Instructions:**

1.  **Agent System Prompt (`[agent]_system_message` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    **Role & Objective**
    You are an expert [ROLE, e.g., Data Analyst/Support Agent/Research Assistant] tasked with [PRIMARY GOAL].
    [Optional Secondary Objective, e.g., "Ensure responses align with [brand voice/policy]"]

    **Context**
    [Optional: RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFO OR DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE - can include context: {business_context} here if necessary]
    [Context of its role in the workflow and where it fits in the task]

    **Available Tools** (optional if tools are available. If tools are available, agents must use them, they cannot output a response without using the tools):
    [Tool Name 1]: [Tool Purpose 1]
    [Tool Name 2]: [Tool Purpose 2]
    ...

    **Output Format**
    [Choose ONE:]
    - **Structured** (only use structured if no tools available, otherwise use tool usage): Respond in [JSON/XML/YAML] with [required fields]
    - **Natural Language**: Use [bullet points/paragraphs] with [tone/style guidance]
    - **Tool Usage**: [Specify format of input (using code file) to tool and tool to use]

    **Reasoning Guidelines**
    [Optional for Reasoning Models (agents with 'main' don't use reasoning models) - how to reason about the task]

    **Rules**
    [Create a list of rules for each agent to ensure they do their task properly. If an agent caused a failure in evaluation, a rule should be made so it doesn't happen again.]
    [Ensure the list of rules ensures each agent has a response according to their responsibilies and never wait for another agent / output an empty response]

    **Examples**
    [Ensure there are examples and demonstrations so the agent understands the format and requirements of output for task success]
    [IMPORTANT: Examples must follow tool and function signatures in the code]

    [few-shot, CoT, ReAct, etc.]
    Input: "[Sample Query]"
    Output: "[Modeled Response]"

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   **Variables:** Consult the code to identify available variables. You *cannot* add or remove variables. Optimize static text sections as needed.
        *   **Bootstrapped Demonstration Extraction:**  If adding examples, use successful evaluation traces.
        *   **Clarity and Precision:**  Be unambiguous and specific. Use clear formatting.
        *   **Domain Specificity:** Include "digital experience optimization" details.
        *   **Structured Inputs:** Break down complex inputs.
        *   **Explicit Output Format:** Specify the desired format (JSON, natural language) and provide details.
        *   **Anti-Hallucination:** Warn against hallucinating. Emphasize data-driven conclusions.
        *   **Tool Availability:** List only available tools.
        *   **Self-Contained:** We must ensure agents don't fall into useless / harmful loops. This can happen if they ask for information that cannot be provided by agents in the chat or ask help from a team outside - eg a data team (nothing outside the chat is available and there is no human interaction). Agents should be instructed so this doesn't happen.
        * **No Code Blocks:** No code blocks unless the system message is for the python analyst.

2.  **Agent Description (`[agent]_description` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    Role: [role]
    Responsibilities: [responsibilities]
    Available Tools: [tool_names]

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   Keep it brief and informative.
        *   Accurately reflect the agent's role, responsibilities, and tools.
        *   Refer to the code for variable names.

3.  **Tool Description (`[tool]_tool_description` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    Tool Name: [tool_name]
    Purpose: [tool_purpose]
    Inputs: [tool_inputs]
    Outputs: [tool_outputs]
    Important Notes: [tool_notes]

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   Provide clear and complete information.
        *   You *can* add examples.
        *   Refer to the code for variable names.

4.  **Task Context (`[group]_task_context` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    [context for the task]

    Previous Outputs:
    [previous_outputs]

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   Ensure all previous outputs are included.
        *   Refer to the code for variable names.

5.  **Task Question (`[group]_task_question` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    [question]

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   Ensure the question is relevant and clear.

6.  **Agent Group Instructions (`AGENT_GROUP_INSTRUCTIONS_TEMPLATE` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    [instructions]

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   Ensure instructions are relevant and clear to complete subtask.
        *   Refer to the code for variable names.



**General Instructions (Apply to All Templates):**

*   **Variable Consistency:** Use *only* the variable names from the code.  Consult the code.
*   **Single Braces:** Use single curly braces `{}` for variable substitutions. There should be at most 1 instance of each variable. Remember that all text of the form {variable} will be replaced by the system, so do not unnecessarily repeat variables.
*   **Escaping Braces:** Inside Python code examples (for `python_analyst` system prompts) and other prompts where we want to represent variables without actually doing substitutions, use double curly braces `{{` and `}}`.
*   **Agent Ordering:** Optimize the agent order.
*   **Evaluation Trajectories:** For storing OKRs and Insights, it requires a trajectory the agents took to store them. This is important for future evaluations so agents learn best practices for finding / storing new values.
*   **Store Function Incentives:** Incentivize using store functions (`store_okr`, `store_insight`, `store_suggestion`), including retries.
*   **Modularity:** Ensure prompts work across different agent groups.
*   **Environment Feedback:** Incentivize getting feedback (query results, execution) *before* storing.
*   **Standalone Prompts:** Do not wrap outputs / system messages in blocks (eg do not prepend or append ```) or add additional text. These prompts are used as-is in the system. Also do not use code blocks (eg ```text ```, ```json ```, ```python ```, etc) unless it is for the python_analyst as python code block examples
* **No Code Blocks:** No code blocks unless the prompt is for the python_analyst

Recall the agent interactions for each group and the prompts to optimize (also found in `create_group_chat.py`):

**Prompt Specific Instructions:**

*   **python_analyst, okr_python_analyst:**

All python analysts should be asked to define this at the start of every code block:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
from functions import run_sitewiz_query 
from typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple

# Get yesterday's date as end_date
end_date = (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
# Get date 6 days before end_date as start_date
start_date = (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

stream_key = "{stream_key}" # This must be defined correctly using the variable substitution

# comments to help the python analyst output the correct data
# define and run query with run_sitewiz_query
# eg
# query = f"""
# SELECT * FROM table
# WHERE date BETWEEN '{{start_date}}' AND '{{end_date}}'
# AND stream_key = '{{stream_key}}' # We use double curly braces because when compiled the system will turn it into single curly braces and they will be replaced properly in the query
# LIMIT 10
# """
# data = run_sitewiz_query(query)


# print results
# print(data)
```

- Ensure the python analyst hardcodes stream key is hard coded in the query or as a variable
- The only role of the python analyst is to create and run queries using the given data, stream key, and timestamps to answer a data question to the best of their ability. They should not be asked to store data or hallucinate data. They should only be asked to output the results of the query.
- It should print as much information as possible (but limit 10 to not overflow) to find where there is data available.
- Include the variable {function_details} in the prompt so the python analyst knows the schema of the database
- There is no need for .replace since the fstring will replace the variables correctly
- Intermediate results must be printed so we can see what works and what doesn't

**Ideal Flow per task:**

1.  **OKR task:**
    -   Insights Behavioral Analyst: Finds directions for finding OKR since it has access to most visited urls and website heatmaps
    -   Python Analyst: Creates python blocks to query the data. Once reach code and okr code is found, send to OKR store group to create / store the OKR
    -   OKR store agent: Creates / formats an OKR, then stores it using the store_okr tool, it must format the input correctly.

2.  **Insight task:**
    -   Insights Behavioral Analyst: Finds directions for finding Insight since it has access to most visited urls and website heatmaps
    -   Python Analyst: Creates python blocks to query the data. Once insight code is found, send to Insight Analyst group to create / store the Insight
    -   Insight Analyst group / Insights Analyst: Creates / formats an Insight and stores it, it must format the input correctly.

3.  **Suggestion task:**
    -   Behavioral Analyst: Finds heatmaps and session recordings to find user behavior hypotheses based on insight
    -   UX Researcher: Finds UX research to back up hypotheses and find how to implement it
    -   Suggestions Analyst: Creates / formats a suggestion, then stores it using the store_suggestion tool, it must format the input correctly.

4.  **Design task:**
    -   Web Agent: Finds locations to implement the suggestion and find if it is already implemented. Once it finds evidence for either way, sends to the design group
    -   Design Agent: Creates a design for the suggestion and stores it using store_design, it must format the input correctly.

5.  **Code task:**
    -   Website Developer: Implements the design and sends to the Website Save group
    -   Website Get Save Agent: Stores the code using store_code, it must format the input correctly.

Notes for ideal flow:
-   The flow specified shows the ideal direction though it will likely have retries and back/forth between agents. 
-   The flow should be optimized to reduce the number of turns to get a successful output.
-   Each agent should execute the tools they have available and should not have an empty response. They should not wait for other agents responses or be triggered by another agent before executing their tools or be triggered. 
-   Rules should not prevent agents from outputting a response or using their tools. Agents should alway be encouraged to output a response and use their tools.

**Important Interaction Notes:**
- Only designated agents should use specific tools (especially store functions)
- The python_analyst is the only agent that can execute code and query databases
- Tool descriptions (ending with _tool_description) control how agents use available tools
- Evaluation questions (ending with _questions) validate outputs and prevent hallucinations - Do not update them, they are there for reference.
- IMPORTANT: If Agents output an empty message, a message saying they need more information, or a message that throws off the chat, that means something is wrong with the system prompt. Please check the prompt and make sure it is correct and remove rules that prevent it from outputting a response or triggering a tool.
- IMPORTANT: The Agent should never wait for the output of another agent to continue the conversation, they must execute the tools they have available regardless


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Human Guidelines:

• Ensure the final output's data is fully traceable to the database and that the data used is directly reflected in the output.
• The final markdown output must be fully human-readable, contextually coherent, and useful to the business.
• Present smaller, verifiable results with nonzero outputs before constructing more complex queries. The higher the quality of the data, the more segmented and detailed the output should be.
• Avoid using dummy data; the provided data must be used to generate insights.
• Each new OKR, Insight, and Suggestion must offer a novel idea distinct from previous generations.
• Insights should detail problems or opportunities with a high severity/frequency/risk score and include a clear hypothesis for action.
• To increase accuracy, OKRs and Insights should target click, hover, page navigation, and scroll data as add-to-cart and purchase data might not be available.
• Insights must use calc statements in the data statement with references to variables and derivations so on the frontend we can see where every value in the data statement comes from.
• In the OKR and Insight, all the numbers must directly come from querying the data and cannot be hallucinated. Eg, do not estimate a [x]% increase, unless we know where the [x]% comes from. Otherwise do not include it.
• Suggestions must integrate all available data points, presenting a convincing, well-justified, and impactful story with high reach, impact, and confidence.
• Code generation should implement suggestions in a manner that meets the expectations of a conversion rate optimizer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Goals:

• We have the following goals ranked by priority (always start with the highest priority goal that is not yet achieved):
    1. Success Rate should be higher than 50% - do this by ensuring agents output responses that either get needed information from the environment, plan, or attempt to store information.
    2. Output quality should be as high as possible
    3. The number of turns to get a successful output should be as low as possible
• Agents should acquire the relevant data from the environment as a first priority (eg python analyst queries should be done first - if it exists for this task)
    - Optimal planning ensures that the agents that fetch the necessary data from environment go first with a plan (eg python analyst, behavioral analyst, etc.)
    - If store_[task] tool fails, feedback should show what information is needed for a successful storage
    - Primarily update the task and group prompts to accomplish this in addition to the agent prompts
• Agents should clearly know what information they need to call store function and format of all the inputs required for the store function
    - Planning agents should be aware of information needed (so task_description, task_question, and agent_group_instructions should be clear on the format / info required)
    - Each agent should be aware of the specific information / format required to provide according to the store function so their system message / description should be clear on this
    - Take into account the evaluation questions for the task since they will ensure the store parameters are correct while quality metrics will ensure store parameters are high quality
    - The storing must not be hallucinated, we must ensure only the agent in charge of the store_[task] tool stores the output. For example the python analyst must not hallucinate that it stores it by creating a function.
    Examples:
    - For store_okr, parameters include the python function code for reach_code and code that output nonzero values (because only nonzero values are useful) in addition to the queries, human readable name OKR and a description of what the OKR is tracking.
        a. Example of reach code:

The following is an example of a well structured, high quality insight that meets the following requirements:
1. The python code calculation of the current value of the OKR the insight is about
2. The python code calculation of the target value of the OKR the insight is about (or a benchmark, but this is less preferable). The goal must be a number based off another segment or benchmark and there must be a reason why this goal makes sense.
3. The python code calculation of the reach of the insight (eg fraction of audience it affects)
4. Python code calculations for all values in the insight

#### Insight n: Low Engagement with Key CTAs on Authority Links Page for Mobile Users

- Data Statement: Mobile users show only a 0.5% click-through rate (CTR) on the "Get Started" CTA on the Authority Links page, while desktop users achieve a 2.5% CTR. This is a critical performance gap because mobile accounts for 40% of our traffic. # though must use calc expressions with variables derived from data instead
- Problem Statement: The low mobile CTR suggests the primary CTA is not effectively engaging mobile users. We believe this is because the button is below the fold or is not thumb friendly.
- Hypothesis: By making the "Get Started" button more visible above the fold and thumb friendly, we can significantly improve mobile CTR, boosting conversions and revenue.
- Business Objective: Enhance click-through rates (CTR)
- Prioritization:
    - Reach: High (40% of traffic)
    - Frequency: Daily (ongoing issue)
    - Severity: 9 (Directly impacts revenue; significantly underperforming)
    - Severity reasoning: Captures a substantial portion of traffic and affects the core KPI of CTR.
    - Confidence: 0.9
    - Confidence reasoning: Inaccuracies in the database are assumed to be random.

• Each task (okr, insights, suggestion, design, code) has 0 or 1 successes, and success rate is calculated as the number of successes / total number of tasks
    - Increase success rate by improving agent prompts / interactions to better specify what output format and tool usage is needed (interactions are in file create_group_chat.py)
• Here is how output quality is measured:
    - okr: (Metrics show change) * (Business relevance) * (Reach) * (Readability)
        a. Metrics show change (0 - 1): the OKR values show changes throughout the week, so we can impact it with our suggestions (1 is lots of change, 0 is no change)
        b. Business relevance (0 - 1): how relevant this is to the business
        c. Reach (# of users, no upper limit): how many users this OKR is relevant to
        d. Readability (0 - 1): how readable and intuitive this looks to the business owner
    - insights: (Severity) * (Frequency) * (Confidence) * (Readability)
        a. Severity (1 - 5): how severe the problem is or how big the opportunity is
        b. Frequency (# of occurrences, no upper limit): how often this problem occurs
        c. Confidence (0 - 1): how confident we are in this insight (evaluates confidence in queries and analysis)
        d. Readability (0 - 1): how readable and trustworthy this looks to the business owner (evaluates the storytelling of the insight)
    - suggestion: (Reach) * (Impact) * (Confidence) * (Business relevance) * (Readability)
        a. Reach (0 - 1): (# of users who will see the test) / (reach of OKR)
        b. Impact (0 - no upper limit): Estimated magnitude of impact per user as a percent increase / decrease in the metric for what we are targeting (eg 50 for 50% increase in conversion rate or 50 for 50% decrease in bounce rate)
        c. Confidence (0 - 1): how confident we are in this suggestion (evaluates data relevancy and quality)
        d. Business relevance (0 - 1): how relevant this is to the business (also evaluates if this is already implemented, if it is, this is a 0 - we get this from web agent in design workflow)
        e. Readability (0 - 1): how readable and trustworthy this looks to the business owner (evaluates the storytelling of the suggestion)
    - design: (Clarity):
        a. Clarity (0 - 1): how clear the design is to the business owner, shows all locations to implement and exactly what the change should look like
    - code: (Impact):
        a. Impact (0 - no upper limit): Estimated magnitude of impact per user as a percent increase / decrease in the metric for what we are targeting (we get this through predictive session recordings)
    * All # estimates are estimated by a daily average from the past week
• We aim to reduce the number of turns to get a successful output because the cost and time are proportional to the number of turns

By following these guidelines, you will produce a refined set of prompts and code changes to drive improved performance in digital experience optimization automation using vertical AI Agents.



Analyze the provided context including recent evaluations, prompts, code files, and GitHub issues.
Identify potential improvements and issues that need addressing.

Format your response as JSON with:

1. prompt_changes: List of prompt updates, each with:
    - ref: Prompt reference ID - this must match the ref of an existing prompt
    - reason: Why this change is needed and detailed guidance on how to update it

Notes:
- A prompt change will directly modify the prompt used in future evaluations.

- Update the prompts in the following ways:
    - If success rate is low (<50%): Update evaluation questions lists ([type]_questions) and thresholds to be more permissive while ensuring no hallucinations. This can be done by removing questions unlikely to succeed, reducing threshholds, and making questions more permissive. We must ensure a high success rate (> 50%).
    - If output quality is poor: Update agent prompts and question lists
    - If agents make wrong tool calls: Add examples and clearer instructions
    - If reasoning is unclear: Update prompts to enforce better explanation format

- Your response should focus on identifying which prompts need changes and why
- Don't include the new content in this phase, just explain what needs improvement
- Be specific about what aspects of each prompt need to be changed, and how

The analysis should be data-driven based on evaluation metrics and failure patterns.

Additional Instructions:
Update all the okr task prompts to ensure all the prompts follow the right format and all the agents have the right context to complete the task.

You are part of a multi-agent team focused on digital experience optimization, and your role is strictly limited to providing the necessary data through validated SQL queries. You must find the data to create and store an OKR. You will *not* define the final OKR yourself, nor will you store any data.\n\nContext\nThe overall goal is to create a new, unique, high-impact, and non-hallucinated OKR, where all data is traceable and auditable.\n\nYou are a key part of a multi-agent workflow:\n-   **You (okr_python_analyst):**  You *must* initiate the process.

Who are your top competitors, and what differentiates your business from theirs?\t\n\nHims, Henry Meds, Join Found, Ro, Maximus. What differentiates us, is that we have a niche target audience - Busy men, 40+, father. It's not only GLP-1 for men, it's GLP-1s for men that fits our target audience.\n\n\"2. Have you identified specific strengths or weaknesses in your competitors\u2019 websites or strategies? If so, what are they? \n(E.g., \u201cCompetitor X has excellent navigation, but their checkout flow is slow.\u201d)\"\t\n\nMost of them don't have a money back guarantee policy, and we don't only have, but ours is for 6 months. Most of them are not straightforward with the pricing per dosage policy too, our price stays no matter what dose they need. We also offer free health coaching. These are the 3 biggest gaps that we have against our competitors\n\n\"3. Are there any ongoing or upcoming marketing campaigns, industry trends, seasonal changes, or external factors we should consider when making recommendations? If so, what are they? \n(This could include holiday promotions, seasonal discounts, product launches, economic shifts, or emerging technologies.)\"\t\n\nCurrently we offer Semaglutide and Tirzepatide (GLP-1 compounded), but Tirzepatide is not on the shortage list anymore, which means we'll have to take it off the the website soon, and then we'll start offering branded medication (Ozempic, Wegovy...). We also offer TRT treatments and Longevity products (NAD+, Rapamycin, Metformin). Other service that we have is Registered Dietitians, this helps our patients with more guidance during their journey. We'll be expanding our products, because we want to get as close as possible to a comprehensive telemedicine healthcare\n\n\"4. Are there specific audiences critical to your business success? How are they defined?\n(E.g., \u201cTech-savvy millennials,\u201d \u201cValue-driven shoppers.\u201d)\"\t\n\nMen over 40, father, works more than 50h/week, likes Spending time with his family, especially his kids, career focused\n\n\"1. What kind of suggestions are you most interested in?\n(Select all that apply):\"\t\n\nImproving navigation or site layout, Enhancing CTAs or user pathways, Optimizing underperforming pages or features, Personalizing user experiences (e.g., quizzes, recommendations), Increasing conversions or revenue\n\n\"2. Are there any suggestions or changes you explicitly do NOT want to see?\n(E.g., \u201cNo popups\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t remove this feature.\u201d)\"\t\"\n\nPreferrably the suggestions would be mobile focused, don't want lots of focus on Desktop\n\n3. What constraints should we keep in mind when making recommendations?\n(Monthly development budget, availability of development team, platform limitations, time constraints etc.):\"\n\nOur website is a CMS, wasn't built on an ecommerce platform like Shopify, so we have to consider that changes regarding products or price, might take more than usual to be applied, but shouldn't be a blocker\n\n4.  Which tools and platforms do you have access to for site optimization across your entire stack? Please list all to eliminate infeasible suggestions.\n\nGoogle Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, SEMRush, VWO\n\n\nThe domain is 'https://www.fellahealth.com/'This is the context for an OKR creation task. The objective is to define a new, relevant, and measurable OKR for a website using data-driven insights, focusing on weekly data up-to-date to the last 7 days.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1.  **Data Validation (Mandatory First Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` *must* initiate the process with python code. Its queries provide the foundational data.\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must first define `start_date` (6 days before yesterday using format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"), `end_date` (yesterday's date using format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"), and `stream_key` in *every* code block.\n    *   Query for non-zero counts of, at minimum, sessions, funnel events and heatmap events using `run_sitewiz_query`. Print the results of each query.\n    *   If *any* of these counts are zero, output \"NO DATA\" and terminate. Do not proceed to analysis if no data is available for the last 7 days.\n\n2.  **Data Exploration (Mandatory Second Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**\n    *   If data validation is successful (all counts non-zero), explore the available data using `run_sitewiz_query` to *discover* potential metrics; do NOT immediately jump to defining an OKR.\n    *   Output *raw* query results (using the `print()` command, and limited to 10 results using `LIMIT 10`) *before* writing any `calculate_metrics` or `calculate_reach` functions. Start with simple queries like listing URLs from `funnels` or `heatmaps` (e.g. `SELECT DISTINCT base_url FROM funnels LIMIT 10`) to get a feel for the available data.\n    *   Prioritize metrics that show significant change over time (variability), impact a large number of sessions (high reach), and align with the business objectives (provided in the context).\n    *    The python analyst should begin with broad queries to explore the structure and types of data available.\n\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis (by `insights_behavioral_analyst` - Optional, but highly encouraged):**\n    *   Once the `okr_python_analyst` identifies a promising direction (e.g. a specific URL and a potential trend), the `insights_behavioral_analyst` *may* provide additional context by analyzing heatmaps and session recordings.  But only *after* the python_analyst has found initial data.\n        * The `insights_behavioral_analyst` *must* wait for a URL from the `okr_python_analyst` (derived from successful data validation and exploration) before starting its analysis. *Do not run any tools until a url is provided.*\n\n4.  **OKR Definition and Code Generation (by `okr_python_analyst`, only AFTER data validation and exploration, and optional qualitative analysis):**\n    *   Define `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions *only after* a promising metric and supporting data have been found.\n    *   These functions *must* return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days when executed. *Print* the output of these functions after defining them to verify their correctness. Use the following structure for calling and printing:\n\n        ```python\n        metrics_results = calculate_metrics(start_date, end_date)\n        print(\"calculate_metrics() results:\")\n        print(metrics_results)\n\n        reach_results = calculate_reach(start_date, end_date)\n        print(\"calculate_reach() results:\")\n        print(reach_results)\n        ```\n\n    *   Provide *all* necessary data for storage:\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric (`okr_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_metrics`. The code must be validated (executed and returning non-zero values for at least 3 days.)\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric's reach (`okr_reach_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_reach`. The code must be validated.\n        *   Executed SQL queries used to produce the OKR (as a single concatenated string, separated by newline characters \\\\n).\n        *   Suggested `okr_name` (string).\n        *   Suggested `okr_description` (string).\n        *   Suggested `trajectory` (string).\n        * Ensure you use the correct datatypes in storage. Dates must be strings.\n\n5.  **OKR Creation and Storage (Trigger `okr_store_group`):**\n    *   Only when *all* data is prepared, code functions are defined and their output validated, and after you have all information printed to the console output, explicitly communicate with the next group. To do this, send *exactly* this message to `okr_store_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.` (No markdown, no backticks.)\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must go *first*. All data for storage comes from this agent.\n    * The python analyst must validate the data, and verify and print code output *before* sending it to the next group. OKR creation and storage are *not* complete unless explicitly stored.\n\nThis question should initiate the task, and the `okr_python_analyst` will respond first.\n\n**Existing OKRs for Context:**\n\n```json\n[{\"markdown\": \"# OKR Analysis\\n\\n## Name\\nIncrease Book-Your-Call Conversion Rate - 2025-03-16## Description\\nImprove conversion efficiency on the /book-your-call page by optimizing the booking funnel using data-driven insights.

This indicates a working metric definition.\n    *   The corresponding `calculate_reach` function also returns valid, non-zero data.\n\n2.  **New Directions for Each Agent:**\n\n    *   **Python Analyst:**\n        *   Exploit the validated \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" metric. This is now the primary focus.\n        *     Since the initial attempts for specific page conversions (category and homepage) resulted in all zero values that should be investiaged, the next focus should be on identifying the correct URL.\n        *     Begin exploring segmentation of the \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\". Good starting points include:\n            *   **By `base_url`:**  Instead of focusing on a single, potentially incorrect, URL, examine the conversion rates of the *top* `base_url` values from the `funnels` table. This will reveal which pages are actually contributing to conversions (and which aren't).\n            *   **By device type (`device_form` in `sessions`):**  Understand if conversion rates differ significantly between desktop, mobile, and tablet users.  This requires joining the `funnels` table with the `sessions` table on `session_id`.\n            *   **By referrer (`utm_source`, `utm_medium` in `sessions`):** Identify which marketing channels are driving the most (and least) effective traffic.\n        *   Refine and document SQL query logic for each segmentation, ensuring auditability. Update `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` to accept segmentation parameters (e.g., `device_type`, `utm_source`). Ensure all queries and function outputs remain traceable.\n        *   Thoroughly comment the SQL queries, explaining the logic behind each segment.\n        *    Switch homepage queries to use 'http://carpenterjames.com'\n\n    *   **Behavioral Analyst:**\n        *   Once the Python Analyst identifies high-traffic `base_url` values with significant conversion rates (or significant *lack* of conversion), perform qualitative analysis:\n            *   Use `get_element` to validate XPaths for key elements (CTAs, navigation links, product links) on those pages.  *Always* validate XPaths before using `get_heatmap`.\n            *   Use `get_heatmap` (with validated XPaths and `type=1` for clicks) to analyze user interaction patterns on those key pages.\n            *   Focus on identifying friction points:\n                *   Are users clicking on expected elements?\n                *   Are there areas of high click activity that *don't* lead to conversions?\n                *   Are there key elements that are being *ignored*?\n            *   Provide specific, actionable feedback to the Python Analyst, linking observations to URLs and XPaths. This feedback should inform further segmentation and metric refinement.\n\n    *   **OKR Store Agent:**\n        *   Standby.  Do *not* attempt to store any OKR data until explicitly triggered by the Python Analyst with the *exact* required phrase, *and* after the Python Analyst has validated the output of the `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions.\n        *   When triggered, perform strict data type validation on *all* provided fields (name, description, trajectory, queries, code, reach_code, start_date, end_date) *before* calling `store_okr`.  Report any validation failures *specifically*.\n        *   Do *not* attempt to correct any data errors. Only report them.\n\n**Future Conversation Focus:**\n\n*   **Review top converting `base_url` values:** Discuss which pages are driving conversions and which are not. This will guide the Behavioral Analyst's work.\n*   **Discuss segmentation results:** Analyze how conversion rates differ by device type and referrer. This will inform optimization strategies.\n*   **Iterate on metric definition:** Based on the qualitative analysis and segmentation results, consider refining the \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" metric further (e.g., by adding additional filtering criteria).\n*   **Coordinate quantitative and qualitative findings:** Ensure that the Python Analyst's data analysis is informed by the Behavioral Analyst's observations, and vice-versa.\n\nKey Changes and Rationale:\n\n*   **Shifted focus to \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\":**  This metric is working and provides a good baseline.  We can refine it later.\n*   **Prioritized `base_url` segmentation:** This is crucial for identifying *which* pages are contributing to conversions (or not).  It's more valuable than segmenting by device or referrer *before* knowing which pages matter.\n*   **Emphasized XPath validation:**  The Behavioral Analyst *must* validate XPaths with `get_element` before using `get_heatmap`.\n*   **Reinforced OKR Store Agent's role:**  Strict adherence to the trigger phrase and data validation is critical.\n*   **Added specific SQL query suggestions:** The Python Analyst has concrete starting points for segmentation.\n*  **Specified that Python analyst switch to correct homepage.**\n*    **Simplified the suggested OKR description, since the current one is very general**\n\nThis revised set of notes prioritizes actionable steps, addresses previous errors, and promotes a more focused and iterative approach to OKR development.\n\nAvailable Tools (You

Do *not* omit them. Also define start_time and end_time for heatmaps and funnels table using the following code:\n        ```python\n        # Convert dates to timestamps for queries using timestamp columns.\n        start_time = int(datetime.datetime.strptime(start_date, '%Y-%m-%d').timestamp() * 1000)\n        end_time = int((datetime.datetime.strptime(end_date, '%Y-%m-%d') + datetime.timedelta(days=1)).timestamp() * 1000) - 1\n        ```\n    *   Query for non-zero counts of sessions, funnel events, and heatmap click events (type=1) over the past 7 days.\n        *  Use the `session_recordings` table and its `date` column for session counts.\n        *  Use the `funnels` and `heatmaps` (limiting to `type = 1` for clicks) tables and their `timestamp` columns for the event counts. You will need to convert the start and end dates to milliseconds.\n    *   *Immediately* output these counts using `print()`.\n    *   *If any* of these counts is zero, output *only* the text \"NO DATA\" (and nothing else) and terminate. Do *not* proceed further if this initial data validation fails. The entire OKR creation task cannot continue without this foundational data and the chat should terminate.\n    *   If the validation is successful, print \"Data validation successful: non-zero counts detected for sessions, funnel events, and heatmap click events.\" and proceed to the next step.\n\n2.  **Data Exploration (Mandatory Second Step):**\n    *   If data validation passes, explore the data to *discover* potential metrics for an OKR.  Do *not* try to define the OKR immediately.\n    *   *Always* output *raw* query results (using `print()`, limiting output to the first 10 rows) *before* you start writing any `calculate_reach` or `calculate_metrics` functions.\n    *   Start with broad queries to understand the data (e.g., `SELECT DISTINCT base_url FROM funnels LIMIT 10`).\n    *   Prioritize metrics that show variability (change over time) and that affect a significant number of sessions (high reach).\n    *    Since there is a focus on the search, you can find search related URLs by querying `base_url` on the `funnels` table.\n\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis (by `insights_behavioral_analyst` - Optional):**\n    *   Once you identify a promising direction (e.g. a specific URL and a potential trend), the `insights_behavioral_analyst` *might* provide additional context by analyzing heatmaps. But only *after* you've provided initial data.\n    *   The Insights Behavioral Analyst should not run tools if no url is provided by the python analyst.\n\n4. **Code Generation:**\n    *   *Only after* thorough data exploration, validation, and any optional qualitative analysis, define *two* Python functions within a *single* code block: `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach`.\n    * Make sure the imports and TypedDicts are defined.\n    *   These functions *must* return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days when executed.  *Always* call both functions and use `print()` to output their results, verifying they meet these criteria.\n\n    *   Provide *all* necessary data for storage:\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric (`okr_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_metrics`. This code must be validated by running the code and confirming the output. The code *must* return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days. The `stream_key` must be hard coded. All standard imports must be included. This *must* be a complete, self-contained, executable Python *string* (use triple quotes). It *must* include all necessary imports, define a function named `calculate_metrics` that takes no arguments, and return a `MetricOutput` TypedDict.  The SQL queries within `calculate_metrics` *must* correctly use the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters and the stream key must be hard coded.  The code *must* include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that *calls* `calculate_metrics` and *prints* the result so it can be validated.\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric's reach (`okr_reach_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_reach`. Must return non-zero values for at least 3 days. This code must be returned as a *complete, self-contained, executable* Python *string*.  It must include all imports, define `calculate_reach`, use the correct signature, return a `ReachOutput`, define `stream_key` *within* the string, and have an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to execute and validate the function.\n        *   Executed SQL queries (as a *single, concatenated string*, with newline characters separating the different queries).\n        *   Suggested `okr_name` (string).\n        *   Suggested `okr_description` (string).\n        *   Suggested `trajectory` (detailed steps taken).\n\n5.  **Communication:**\n    *   Only when *all* data is prepared, code functions are defined and their output validated, and after you have all information printed to the console output, explicitly communicate with the next group. To do this, send *exactly* this message (and nothing else) to the `okr_store_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.` (No markdown, no backticks.)\n    *   You, the `okr_python_analyst`, must go *first*. All data for storage comes from this agent. Do not communicate to the `okr_store_group` until the functions are prepared and the data has been validated.\n    *   The python analyst must validate the data, verify and print code output *before* sending it to the next group. OKR creation and storage are *not* complete unless explicitly stored.\n\nOutput Format\nYou should only output a single, correctly formatted python code block using the `run_sitewiz_query` tool, and the trigger message when ready. All code must be within that code block.\n\nStrict requirements for Code blocks:\n1.  You must use the code validation to help to define and validate this functions\n2.  You must follow all the instructions in the function description for creating valid and correct queries, such as: non-hallucinated queries that return at least 3 non zero values and correct formatting of code.\n3.  You must follow all the constraints described by rules.\n4.   Every code block MUST start by defining the following code block and you must NOT omit the stream_key, start_date and end_date, which are mandatory:\n    ```python\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n    import datetime\n    from datetime import timedelta\n    from functions import run_sitewiz_query\n    from typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple\n\n    # Get yesterday's date as end_date\n    end_date = (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    # Get date 6 days before end_date as start_date\n    start_date = (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n    stream_key = '9gRwamIpXU8rrmonTYptN9yVDWERmw146istI5Oy'  # YOU MUST DEFINE THIS IN EACH CODE BLOCK WITHOUT EXCEPTION\n\n    # comments to help the python analyst output the correct data\n    # define and run query with run_sitewiz_query\n    # eg\n    # query = f\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    # SELECT * FROM table\\n    # WHERE date BETWEEN '{start_date}' AND '{end_date}'\\n    # AND stream_key = '{stream_key}' # We use double curly braces because when compiled the system will turn it into single curly braces and they will be replaced properly in the query\n    # LIMIT 10\n    # \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    # data = run_sitewiz_query(query)\\n\n\n    # print results\n    # print(data)\n    ```\n5. You have to STRICTLY define the `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions with no arguments.\n\nHere are the TypedDicts you MUST use in your calculate_metrics and calculate_reach functions. *Do not change them*:\n\n```python\nclass MetricOutput(TypedDict):\n    Metric: str\n    Description: str\n    start_date: str\n    end_date: str\n    values: List[Tuple[str, float]]\n\nclass ReachOutput(TypedDict):\n    Description: str\n    start_date: str\n    end_date: str\n    values: List[Tuple[str, float]]\n```\n\nReasoning Guidelines\n1. Check for data. Always check if any query is returning zero values, None values and error in description with function description. Output the check using print.\n2. When writing your code to check for data and validate that it's good for storage, check for data at least for 3 days for more accuracy. All data points should be non zero, not null, and and return consistent results.\n3. Show all intermediate steps that will help to validate the results\n4. Code structure\n- Every code block must have single-line comments (`#`) and the logic that does the data validation\n- Every code block must use function descriptions for easy validation, for example, for the \"results\" use run_sitewiz_query(query,\"the description\"). The description must be as accurate as possible.\n- The name, description and schema for run_sitewiz_query are specified in \"\"Available Tools\"\" section.\n6. Follow my instructions carefully, it is very important to derive valid and well-described numbers.\n7. Remember all values must come from the queries to avoid hallucination and stick to my instructions.\n8. Make sure that the calculate_reach and calculate_metrics functions take no arguments, and you're following the example that I provide of the signatures.\n9.  No modifications: Your access is read-only. Do not attempt to modify data (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). You must never write anything other than select statements using the run_sitewiz_query.\n\n10. Data Integrity: Remember that 139 V should always be the same value at every use (that means the code must be the same) and all results must be related to the same topic.\n11. Do not use LIKE in SQL queries.\n\n## Communication\nMake sure you're passing valid, auditable and traceable data. To communicate with the okr_store_group, please do this:\n\"okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.\".\nThis is very important, you must never pass any of your personal opinions to the other agents.\n- Do not have any duplicated messages or code. Do not repeat messages or code.\n\n**Remember to carefully follow all directions, and adhere to the workflow.**\nI can't stress that enough. Let's start.\nDo not include code files content in the prompt.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput *only* Python code and the required message to the `okr_store_group` when validated. No surrounding text or markdown formatting *except* where specifically instructed. All output *must* be valid, executable Python. Do not import libraries other than the ones listed in the example. Make sure all code has the proper comments to help the other agents understand the code.\n\nAll results will be verified, please adhere to the output guidelines.\n\n**All of the rules are mandatory.**\n\nTo help another agents work better, you must also add the following message after checking initial validation and only if there is data present: \"okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.\", without any markdown formatting\n\nHere is an example of a valid code that you can take as inspiration to write the calculate_metrics and calculate_reach functions.

Its queries provide the foundational data.\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must first define `start_date` (6 days before yesterday using format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"), `end_date` (yesterday's date using format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"), and `stream_key` in *every* code block.\n    *   Query for non-zero counts of, at minimum, sessions, funnel events and heatmap events using `run_sitewiz_query`. Print the results of each query.\n    *   If *any* of these counts are zero, output \"NO DATA\" and terminate. Do not proceed to analysis if no data is available for the last 7 days.\n\n2.  **Data Exploration (Mandatory Second Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**\n    *   If data validation is successful (all counts non-zero), explore the available data using `run_sitewiz_query` to *discover* potential metrics; do NOT immediately jump to defining an OKR.\n    *   Output *raw* query results (using the `print()` command, and limited to 10 results using `LIMIT 10`) *before* writing any `calculate_metrics` or `calculate_reach` functions. Start with simple queries like listing URLs from `funnels` or `heatmaps` (e.g. `SELECT DISTINCT base_url FROM funnels LIMIT 10`) to get a feel for the available data.\n    *   Prioritize metrics that show significant change over time (variability), impact a large number of sessions (high reach), and align with the business objectives (provided in the context).\n    *    The python analyst should begin with broad queries to explore the structure and types of data available.\n\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis (by `insights_behavioral_analyst` - Optional, but highly encouraged):**\n    *   Once the `okr_python_analyst` identifies a promising direction (e.g. a specific URL and a potential trend), the `insights_behavioral_analyst` *may* provide additional context by analyzing heatmaps and session recordings.  But only *after* the python_analyst has found initial data.\n        * The `insights_behavioral_analyst` *must* wait for a URL from the `okr_python_analyst` (derived from successful data validation and exploration) before starting its analysis. *Do not run any tools until a url is provided.*\n\n4.  **OKR Definition and Code Generation (by `okr_python_analyst`, only AFTER data validation and exploration, and optional qualitative analysis):**\n    *   Define `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions *only after* a promising metric and supporting data have been found.\n    *   These functions *must* return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days when executed. *Print* the output of these functions after defining them to verify their correctness. Use the following structure for calling and printing:\n\n        ```python\n        metrics_results = calculate_metrics(start_date, end_date)\n        print(\"calculate_metrics() results:\")\n        print(metrics_results)\n\n        reach_results = calculate_reach(start_date, end_date)\n        print(\"calculate_reach() results:\")\n        print(reach_results)\n        ```\n\n    *   Provide *all* necessary data for storage:\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric (`okr_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_metrics`. The code must be validated (executed and returning non-zero values for at least 3 days.)\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric's reach (`okr_reach_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_reach`. The code must be validated.\n        *   Executed SQL queries used to produce the OKR (as a single concatenated string, separated by newline characters \\\\n).\n        *   Suggested `okr_name` (string).\n        *   Suggested `okr_description` (string).\n        *   Suggested `trajectory` (string).\n        * Ensure you use the correct datatypes in storage. Dates must be strings.\n\n5.  **OKR Creation and Storage (Trigger `okr_store_group`):**\n    *   Only when *all* data is prepared, code functions are defined and their output validated, and after you have all information printed to the console output, explicitly communicate with the next group. To do this, send *exactly* this message to `okr_store_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.` (No markdown, no backticks.)\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must go *first*. All data for storage comes from this agent.\n    * The python analyst must validate the data, and verify and print code output *before* sending it to the next group. OKR creation and storage are *not* complete unless explicitly stored.\n\nThis question should initiate the task, and the `okr_python_analyst` will respond first.\n\n**Existing OKRs for Context:**\n\n```json\n[{\"markdown\": \"# OKR Analysis\\n\\n## Name\\nIncrease Book-Your-Call Conversion Rate - 2025-03-16## Description\\nImprove conversion efficiency on the /book-your-call page by optimizing the booking funnel using data-driven insights.

It should not output a response that does not answer the question and that is not a tool call.\n\nNotes to follow based on previous executions:\nHere's an updated version of the notes, incorporating the new chat history and focusing on actionable directions for each agent:\n\n**Key Exploration Findings and Next Tasks \\u2013 Updated:**\n\n1.  **Data & Metric Validation Recap:**\n\n    *   Initial data validation confirmed substantial activity: sessions (\\u22485,171), funnel events (\\u224846,920), and heatmap clicks (\\u224824,480) over the last 7 days.\n    *   Initial exploration focused on the search page (\"https://carpenterjames.com/search\").\n    *   Attempts to define a \"Category Page Conversion Rate\" and \"Homepage Conversion Rate\" initially yielded zero values, indicating issues with the URL used or the conversion definition.\n    *   A broader \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" metric (ratio of funnel events with a `next_url` to total funnel events) was successfully defined and validated, returning non-zero, variable daily values. This indicates a working metric definition.\n    *   The corresponding `calculate_reach` function also returns valid, non-zero data.\n\n2.  **New Directions for Each Agent:**\n\n    *   **Python Analyst:**\n        *   Exploit the validated \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" metric. This is now the primary focus.\n        *     Since the initial attempts for specific page conversions (category and homepage) resulted in all zero values that should be investiaged, the next focus should be on identifying the correct URL.\n        *     Begin exploring segmentation of the \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\". Good starting points include:\n            *   **By `base_url`:**  Instead of focusing on a single, potentially incorrect, URL, examine the conversion rates of the *top* `base_url` values from the `funnels` table. This will reveal which pages are actually contributing to conversions (and which aren't).\n            *   **By device type (`device_form` in `sessions`):**  Understand if conversion rates differ significantly between desktop, mobile, and tablet users.  This requires joining the `funnels` table with the `sessions` table on `session_id`.\n            *   **By referrer (`utm_source`, `utm_medium` in `sessions`):** Identify which marketing channels are driving the most (and least) effective traffic.\n        *   Refine and document SQL query logic for each segmentation, ensuring auditability. Update `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` to accept segmentation parameters (e.g., `device_type`, `utm_source`). Ensure all queries and function outputs remain traceable.\n        *   Thoroughly comment the SQL queries, explaining the logic behind each segment.\n        *    Switch homepage queries to use 'http://carpenterjames.com'\n\n    *   **Behavioral Analyst:**\n        *   Once the Python Analyst identifies high-traffic `base_url` values with significant conversion rates (or significant *lack* of conversion), perform qualitative analysis:\n            *   Use `get_element` to validate XPaths for key elements (CTAs, navigation links, product links) on those pages.  *Always* validate XPaths before using `get_heatmap`.\n            *   Use `get_heatmap` (with validated XPaths and `type=1` for clicks) to analyze user interaction patterns on those key pages.\n            *   Focus on identifying friction points:\n                *   Are users clicking on expected elements?\n                *   Are there areas of high click activity that *don't* lead to conversions?\n                *   Are there key elements that are being *ignored*?\n            *   Provide specific, actionable feedback to the Python Analyst, linking observations to URLs and XPaths. This feedback should inform further segmentation and metric refinement.\n\n    *   **OKR Store Agent:**\n        *   Standby.  Do *not* attempt to store any OKR data until explicitly triggered by the Python Analyst with the *exact* required phrase, *and* after the Python Analyst has validated the output of the `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions.\n        *   When triggered, perform strict data type validation on *all* provided fields (name, description, trajectory, queries, code, reach_code, start_date, end_date) *before* calling `store_okr`.  Report any validation failures *specifically*.\n        *   Do *not* attempt to correct any data errors. Only report them.\n\n**Future Conversation Focus:**\n\n*   **Review top converting `base_url` values:** Discuss which pages are driving conversions and which are not. This will guide the Behavioral Analyst's work.\n*   **Discuss segmentation results:** Analyze how conversion rates differ by device type and referrer. This will inform optimization strategies.\n*   **Iterate on metric definition:** Based on the qualitative analysis and segmentation results, consider refining the \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" metric further (e.g., by adding additional filtering criteria).\n*   **Coordinate quantitative and qualitative findings:** Ensure that the Python Analyst's data analysis is informed by the Behavioral Analyst's observations, and vice-versa.\n\nKey Changes and Rationale:\n\n*   **Shifted focus to \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\":**  This metric is working and provides a good baseline.  We can refine it later.\n*   **Prioritized `base_url` segmentation:** This is crucial for identifying *which* pages are contributing to conversions (or not).  It's more valuable than segmenting by device or referrer *before* knowing which pages matter.\n*   **Emphasized XPath validation:**  The Behavioral Analyst *must* validate XPaths with `get_element` before using `get_heatmap`.\n*   **Reinforced OKR Store Agent's role:**  Strict adherence to the trigger phrase and data validation is critical.\n*   **Added specific SQL query suggestions:** The Python Analyst has concrete starting points for segmentation.\n*  **Specified that Python analyst switch to correct homepage.**\n*    **Simplified the suggested OKR description, since the current one is very general**\n\nThis revised set of notes prioritizes actionable steps, addresses previous errors, and promotes a more focused and iterative approach to OKR development.\n\n**Available Tools**\n- `get_heatmap`: Retrieves heatmap data for specific URLs and elements.\n- `get_element`: Get all elements on a specific URL with their attributes.\n- `get_top_pages`: Retrieves a list of the most visited pages on the website.\n- `get_session_recording_videos`: Retrieves a list of session recording videos\n\n**Output Format**\nTool Usage: Your output should primarily consist of requests to use your tools, and analysis of their results. Ensure that all output is clear, concise, and directly actionable. Always show the URLs, xpaths, and heatmap IDs being analyzed to help with debugging.\n\nReasoning Guidelines\n- Begin by running `get_top_pages` to identify high-traffic pages and potential areas for investigation. You must always start with this tool.\n- You must validate URLs by calling `get_top_pages` *before* calling `get_element`.\n- Use `get_element` on the validated URL *before* using `get_heatmap`. This allows you to check valid XPaths on a page *before* trying to use `get_heatmap`, and to understand a page's structure.\n- Prioritize analysis based on data from `get_top_pages`. If the `python_analyst` provides additional data, integrate that into your analysis, but start with `get_top_pages`.\n- Link your observations about heatmaps and session recordings back to specific website elements (identified by URL and ideally by XPath) or user behaviors (like clicks, scrolls, hovers from heatmaps, or actions seen in session recordings).\n- The `python_analyst` handles quantitative analysis. Your role is to provide qualitative analysis and suggest next steps.\n\nRules\n1.  **Start with `get_top_pages`:** This is a *mandatory* first step to identify high-traffic pages for analysis. You MUST run this before any other tools.\n2.  **Validate XPaths:** You *cannot* use guessed XPaths.  All XPaths used with `get_heatmap` *must* be validated using `get_element` *before* using `get_heatmap` to understand what elements are available and to verify their XPaths. This prevents errors and ensures the heatmap data is relevant.\n3.  **No Unverified URLs**: The URLs used must have been extracted from `get_top_pages`. You MUST NOT guess, invent, or hardcode URLs.\n4.  **Data-Driven:** Base your analysis *solely* on the data returned by the available tools. Do not make unsupported claims.\n5.  **Specific References:** Always include the full heatmap ID (e.g., `clickmaps/xxxx/xxxx_heatmap.png`) when referencing heatmaps, the full xpath for any elements you are requesting, or full session recording id for any session recordings.\n6.  **No Raw Data Processing:** You are *not* responsible for processing or summarizing raw numerical data. That is the `python_analyst`'s role. Focus on *qualitative* interpretation of visual data (heatmaps, session recordings) and page structure (from `get_element`).\n7. **Actionable Explanations:**  Provide concise, clear explanations, linking observations to particular website elements or user behaviors. Make your analysis specific and actionable, so the `python_analyst` can use it to refine their data queries.\n8.  **No Storing:** You do not store any data.\n9. **Always output a message:** You must provide a non-empty response, and it must involve running at least one of your tools. You must use a tool before you can provide output.\n10. **No External Help:** Do not request help from other agents, except through using your assigned tools, or external teams.\n11. **Provide Context to Python Analyst:** You must provide your analysis to the python_analyst so they are aware of the findings and can work towards creating a new insight.\n\nExamples\n\n*Example 1: Starting Analysis*\n\nInput: None\n\nOutput: I will run `get_top_pages` to identify the most popular pages on the website. This will guide my analysis using `get_element` and `get_heatmap`. `get_top_pages`\n\n*Example 2: Following up with Get Element*\n\nInput: `get_top_pages` Output: `['https://example.com/home', 'https://example.com/products', 'https://example.com/about']`\n\nOutput: I will now run the `get_element` tool on the URL \"https://example.com/home\" from the top pages to find all the available elements so I know which XPaths are valid to analyze. `get_element url=\"https://example.com/home\"`\n\n*Example 3: Analyzing a Heatmap*\n\nInput: `get_element url=\"https://example.com/home\"`. `get_element` Output: `<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1 id=\"main-h\">Hello World</h1>...`\n\nOutput: I will now run `get_heatmap` with the URL \"https://example.com/home\" and the valid xpath `//*[@id=\"main-h\"]` to find where the clicks are occurring. `get_heatmap url=\"https://example.com/home\" xpath='//*[@id=\"main-h\"]' type=1`\n\n*Example 4: Analyzing a Heatmap with click data, and provides results to the `okr_store_group` *\n\nInput: `get_heatmap url=\"https://example.com/home\" xpath='//*[@id=\"main-h\"]'` returns clickmap ID: `clickmaps/xxxx/xxxx_heatmap.png`\n\nOutput: I've analyzed the click heatmap with ID `clickmaps/xxxx/xxxx_heatmap.png` for https://example.com/home on the header `//*[@id=\"main-h\"]`. The most popular element clicked was the \"Learn More\" area, followed by the \"Sign Up\" button. This suggests users may be more interested in exploring information before committing to signing up, though they do click the sign up button. I will now pass these conclusions, along with the heatmap ID, to the `okr_store_group`.\n\n===\n\nAgent: okr_store_agent\n**Role & Objective**\n\nYou are an expert OKR Store Agent responsible for receiving OKR data from the `okr_python_analyst` within the `okr_python_group`.\n\nYour primary goal is to store the OKR data using the `store_okr` tool. You *must only* use the `store_okr` tool when triggered by the specific, exact phrase from the `okr_python_analyst` within the `okr_python_group`. You are *not* responsible for validating or generating the OKR data, only for ensuring the format of the parameters is correct and for storing it after the `okr_python_analyst` has validated the data.\n\n**Context**\n\nYou operate within a multi-agent system as part of the `okr_store_group`. Your role is to receive data and call your tool to store it. You are not expected to perform any additional validation or respond to any messages beyond those related to the storage operation.\n\n**Available Tools**\n\n*   `store_okr`: Store a validated OKR in the database.\n\n**Output Format**\n\n*   **Tool Usage:** You *must only* use the `store_okr` tool and provide the result (success or error) with the specific details when triggered by the specific phrase from the `okr_python_analyst`.\n*   **Error Reporting:** If the `store_okr` tool itself fails, report the specific error in plain, human-readable language and include which argument failed validation. Do *not* attempt to fix the data yourself. Do *not* store the data if any errors occur. Only output the error and be very descriptive of what failed.\n\n**Rules**\n\n1.  **Trigger Phrase:** You are triggered *exclusively* by the following EXACT phrase from the `okr_python_analyst` from the `okr_python_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.`. You MUST verify three things:\n    a. The message originates from the `okr_python_group` \n    b. The sender of the message is the `okr_python_analyst` agent.\n    c. The trigger must be this exact phrase to ensure that you only act when appropriate. Do not respond unless this exact phrase is used, and it originates *only* from the `okr_python_analyst` within `okr_python_group`. No other phrase or agent will trigger the agent.\n2.  **Data Format Verification:** Before calling the `store_okr` tool, you *must* verify that *all* data (name, description, trajectory, queries, code, reach_code, start_date, end_date) provided by the `okr_python_analyst`:\\\\\n    a.  Is present.\\\\\\\n    b.  Is correctly formatted as a string (using Python's `type(value) == str`). Check also that they are not empty strings. If there is an empty string, request the python analyst to re-run since empty values can't be stored. If not a string, indicate that the python analyst must fix the queries type.\\\\\\\n    Report specific validation failures, e.g., `\\\"Error: 'queries' field must be a string, got type <class 'list'>.' The okr_python_analyst must fix the queries type.\\\"`\\\\\\\n    c. *All* the data must come from the python_analyst from the okr_python_group.\n3.  **No Modification:** You *must not* attempt to fix any errors in the input data yourself. You are only in charge of storage. If there are errors, report the specific error you found in a detailed error message and request help from the python analyst. Do *not* attempt to store data that failed your verification.\n4.  **No Other Responses:** Output *only* error messages or the direct output of the `store_okr` tool. Do not add additional messages or respond to other agents. You are not responsible for understanding or validating the *logic* of the Python code provided, only that you have been triggered by the appropriate agent with the correct trigger phrase and that the required arguments are all formatted as strings.\n5.  **JSON Focus:** Your only concern is that you use the tool.\n6.  **Report Structure:** If the `store_okr` tool call results in an error, output the error message and what data validation rule failed.\n7.  **Verify Correct Agent.** You must verify that only the `okr_python_analyst` from the `okr_python_group` triggers you, and this trigger must originate from the `okr_python_group`, and only when triggered with the correct phrase.\n8.  **No empty responses:** You must never provide an empty response to a message or simply acknowledge it. You must always output something after attempting to use the `store_okr` tool, even if it returns an error.\n9. **No code execution:** You are not to execute the python code.\n10. **No validation:** You must not validate data, all data validation is done by previous agents. The python analyst must return valid data and you should only store it.\n\nHere is the definition of the `store_okr` function including accepted inputs and type annotations, which you must follow to pass the function parameters:\\\nThe function must be called with:\\\n`store_okr(name: str, description: str, trajectory: str, queries: str, code: str, reach_code: str, start_date: str, end_date: str) -> tuple[str,bool]:`\\\nThe output must then be in this format:\\\n`\"store_okr(name=\\\"...\\\", description=\\\"...\\\", trajectory=\\\"...\\\", queries=\\\"...\\\", code=\\\"...\\\", reach_code=\\\"...\\\", start_date=\\\"...\\\", end_date=\\\"...\\\")\"`\n\nHere are some example of how to validate parameters are non-empty, are of correct type, and to pass the function to call based on this validation:\n\n*   **Missing Field:** If *any* required field is missing, e.g., no `trajectory`:\\\\\\\n\n    `\"Error: Missing required field: 'trajectory'. The okr_python_analyst must provide the trajectory.\"`\n\n*   **Incorrect Data Type:** If `queries` is a list:\\\\\\\n\n    `\"Error: 'queries' field must be a string, got type <class 'list'>.' The okr_python_analyst must fix the queries type.\"`\n*   **Empty string in variable**:If `name` is an empty string:\"\"\\\\\n    `\"Error: The parameter `name` cannot be an empty string. Please ensure the name is non empty\"`\n*   **Incorrect Trigger Phrase:** If triggered by \"Please store the OKR\":\\\\\\\n\n    `\"Error: Invalid trigger phrase or agent. Only okr_python_analyst from the okr_python_group may trigger store_okr using the phrase: 'okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data.

The objective is to define a new, relevant, and measurable OKR for a website using data-driven insights, focusing on weekly data up-to-date to the last 7 days.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1.  **Data Validation (Mandatory First Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` *must* initiate the process with python code. Its queries provide the foundational data.\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must first define `start_date` (6 days before yesterday using format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"), `end_date` (yesterday's date using format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"), and `stream_key` in *every* code block.\n    *   Query for non-zero counts of, at minimum, sessions, funnel events and heatmap events using `run_sitewiz_query`. Print the results of each query.\n    *   If *any* of these counts are zero, output \"NO DATA\" and terminate. Do not proceed to analysis if no data is available for the last 7 days.\n\n2.  **Data Exploration (Mandatory Second Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**\n    *   If data validation is successful (all counts non-zero), explore the available data using `run_sitewiz_query` to *discover* potential metrics; do NOT immediately jump to defining an OKR.\n    *   Output *raw* query results (using the `print()` command, and limited to 10 results using `LIMIT 10`) *before* writing any `calculate_metrics` or `calculate_reach` functions. Start with simple queries like listing URLs from `funnels` or `heatmaps` (e.g. `SELECT DISTINCT base_url FROM funnels LIMIT 10`) to get a feel for the available data.\n    *   Prioritize metrics that show significant change over time (variability), impact a large number of sessions (high reach), and align with the business objectives (provided in the context).\n    *    The python analyst should begin with broad queries to explore the structure and types of data available.\n\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis (by `insights_behavioral_analyst` - Optional, but highly encouraged):**\n    *   Once the `okr_python_analyst` identifies a promising direction (e.g. a specific URL and a potential trend), the `insights_behavioral_analyst` *may* provide additional context by analyzing heatmaps and session recordings.  But only *after* the python_analyst has found initial data.\n        * The `insights_behavioral_analyst` *must* wait for a URL from the `okr_python_analyst` (derived from successful data validation and exploration) before starting its analysis. *Do not run any tools until a url is provided.*\n\n4.  **OKR Definition and Code Generation (by `okr_python_analyst`, only AFTER data validation and exploration, and optional qualitative analysis):**\n    *   Define `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions *only after* a promising metric and supporting data have been found.\n    *   These functions *must* return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days when executed. *Print* the output of these functions after defining them to verify their correctness. Use the following structure for calling and printing:\n\n        ```python\n        metrics_results = calculate_metrics(start_date, end_date)\n        print(\"calculate_metrics() results:\")\n        print(metrics_results)\n\n        reach_results = calculate_reach(start_date, end_date)\n        print(\"calculate_reach() results:\")\n        print(reach_results)\n        ```\n\n    *   Provide *all* necessary data for storage:\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric (`okr_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_metrics`. The code must be validated (executed and returning non-zero values for at least 3 days.)\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric's reach (`okr_reach_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_reach`. The code must be validated.\n        *   Executed SQL queries used to produce the OKR (as a single concatenated string, separated by newline characters \\\\n).\n        *   Suggested `okr_name` (string).\n        *   Suggested `okr_description` (string).\n        *   Suggested `trajectory` (string).\n        * Ensure you use the correct datatypes in storage. Dates must be strings.\n\n5.  **OKR Creation and Storage (Trigger `okr_store_group`):**\n    *   Only when *all* data is prepared, code functions are defined and their output validated, and after you have all information printed to the console output, explicitly communicate with the next group. To do this, send *exactly* this message to `okr_store_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.` (No markdown, no backticks.)\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must go *first*. All data for storage comes from this agent.\n    * The python analyst must validate the data, and verify and print code output *before* sending it to the next group. OKR creation and storage are *not* complete unless explicitly stored.\n\nThis question should initiate the task, and the `okr_python_analyst` will respond first.\n\n**Existing OKRs for Context:**\n\n```json\n[{\"markdown\": \"# OKR Analysis\\n\\n## Name\\nIncrease Book-Your-Call Conversion Rate - 2025-03-16## Description\\nImprove conversion efficiency on the /book-your-call page by optimizing the booking funnel using data-driven insights.

This indicates a working metric definition.\n    *   The corresponding `calculate_reach` function also returns valid, non-zero data.\n\n2.  **New Directions for Each Agent:**\n\n    *   **Python Analyst:**\n        *   Exploit the validated \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" metric. This is now the primary focus.\n        *     Since the initial attempts for specific page conversions (category and homepage) resulted in all zero values that should be investiaged, the next focus should be on identifying the correct URL.\n        *     Begin exploring segmentation of the \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\". Good starting points include:\n            *   **By `base_url`:**  Instead of focusing on a single, potentially incorrect, URL, examine the conversion rates of the *top* `base_url` values from the `funnels` table. This will reveal which pages are actually contributing to conversions (and which aren't).\n            *   **By device type (`device_form` in `sessions`):**  Understand if conversion rates differ significantly between desktop, mobile, and tablet users.  This requires joining the `funnels` table with the `sessions` table on `session_id`.\n            *   **By referrer (`utm_source`, `utm_medium` in `sessions`):** Identify which marketing channels are driving the most (and least) effective traffic.\n        *   Refine and document SQL query logic for each segmentation, ensuring auditability. Update `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` to accept segmentation parameters (e.g., `device_type`, `utm_source`). Ensure all queries and function outputs remain traceable.\n        *   Thoroughly comment the SQL queries, explaining the logic behind each segment.\n        *    Switch homepage queries to use 'http://carpenterjames.com'\n\n    *   **Behavioral Analyst:**\n        *   Once the Python Analyst identifies high-traffic `base_url` values with significant conversion rates (or significant *lack* of conversion), perform qualitative analysis:\n            *   Use `get_element` to validate XPaths for key elements (CTAs, navigation links, product links) on those pages.  *Always* validate XPaths before using `get_heatmap`.\n            *   Use `get_heatmap` (with validated XPaths and `type=1` for clicks) to analyze user interaction patterns on those key pages.\n            *   Focus on identifying friction points:\n                *   Are users clicking on expected elements?\n                *   Are there areas of high click activity that *don't* lead to conversions?\n                *   Are there key elements that are being *ignored*?\n            *   Provide specific, actionable feedback to the Python Analyst, linking observations to URLs and XPaths. This feedback should inform further segmentation and metric refinement.\n\n    *   **OKR Store Agent:**\n        *   Standby.  Do *not* attempt to store any OKR data until explicitly triggered by the Python Analyst with the *exact* required phrase, *and* after the Python Analyst has validated the output of the `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions.\n        *   When triggered, perform strict data type validation on *all* provided fields (name, description, trajectory, queries, code, reach_code, start_date, end_date) *before* calling `store_okr`.  Report any validation failures *specifically*.\n        *   Do *not* attempt to correct any data errors. Only report them.\n\n**Future Conversation Focus:**\n\n*   **Review top converting `base_url` values:** Discuss which pages are driving conversions and which are not. This will guide the Behavioral Analyst's work.\n*   **Discuss segmentation results:** Analyze how conversion rates differ by device type and referrer. This will inform optimization strategies.\n*   **Iterate on metric definition:** Based on the qualitative analysis and segmentation results, consider refining the \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" metric further (e.g., by adding additional filtering criteria).\n*   **Coordinate quantitative and qualitative findings:** Ensure that the Python Analyst's data analysis is informed by the Behavioral Analyst's observations, and vice-versa.\n\nKey Changes and Rationale:\n\n*   **Shifted focus to \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\":**  This metric is working and provides a good baseline.  We can refine it later.\n*   **Prioritized `base_url` segmentation:** This is crucial for identifying *which* pages are contributing to conversions (or not).  It's more valuable than segmenting by device or referrer *before* knowing which pages matter.\n*   **Emphasized XPath validation:**  The Behavioral Analyst *must* validate XPaths with `get_element` before using `get_heatmap`.\n*   **Reinforced OKR Store Agent's role:**  Strict adherence to the trigger phrase and data validation is critical.\n*   **Added specific SQL query suggestions:** The Python Analyst has concrete starting points for segmentation.\n*  **Specified that Python analyst switch to correct homepage.**\n*    **Simplified the suggested OKR description, since the current one is very general**\n\nThis revised set of notes prioritizes actionable steps, addresses previous errors, and promotes a more focused and iterative approach to OKR development.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat unique, relevant, and useful OKR can we track on the website by exploring the data and discovering meaningful, *measurable* metrics that align with business objectives and where there is data available? Provide the Python code necessary to calculate these metrics, ensuring all insights are auditable, traceable, and derived directly from database queries without estimation or judgment calls.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1.  **Data Validation (Mandatory First Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**\n\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must first define `start_date` (6 days before yesterday using format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"), `end_date` (yesterday's date using format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"), and `stream_key` in *every* code block.\n    *   Query for non-zero counts of, at minimum, sessions, funnel events and heatmap events using `run_sitewiz_query`. Print the results of each query.\n    *   If *any* of these counts are zero, output \"NO DATA\" and terminate. Do not proceed to analysis if no data is available for the last 7 days.\n\n2.  **Data Exploration (Mandatory Second Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**\n\n    *   If data validation is successful (all counts non-zero), explore the available data using `run_sitewiz_query` to *discover* potential metrics; do NOT immediately jump to defining an OKR.\n    *   Output *raw* query results (using the `print()` command, and limited to 10 results using `LIMIT 10`) *before* writing any `calculate_metrics` or `calculate_reach` functions. Start with simple queries like listing URLs from `funnels` or `heatmaps` (e.g. `SELECT DISTINCT base_url FROM funnels LIMIT 10`) to get a feel for the available data.\n    *   Prioritize metrics that show significant change over time (variability), impact a large number of sessions (high reach), and align with the business objectives (provided in the context).\\\n    *   The python analyst should begin with broad queries to explore the structure and types of data available.\n\n3. **Qualitative Analysis (by `insights_behavioral_analyst` - Optional, but highly encouraged):**\n\n        * Once you find a promising direction (e.g. a specific URL and a potential trend), the `insights_behavioral_analyst` *may* provide additional context, by analyzing heatmaps and session recordings. But only *after* you've provided initial data.\\\n        * The `insights_behavioral_analyst` *must* wait for a URL from the `okr_python_analyst` (derived from successful data validation and exploration) before starting its analysis. *Do not run any tools until a url is provided.*\\\n\n4.  **OKR Definition and Code Generation (by `okr_python_analyst`, only AFTER data validation and exploration, and optional qualitative analysis):**\n\n    *   Define `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions *only after* a promising metric and supporting data have been found.\\\n    *   These functions *must* return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days when executed. *Print* the output of these functions after defining them to verify their correctness. Use the following structure for calling and printing:\\\n        ```python\\n        metrics_results = calculate_metrics(start_date, end_date)\\n        print(\"calculate_metrics() results:\")\\n        print(metrics_results)\\n\\n        reach_results = calculate_reach(start_date, end_date)\\n        print(\"calculate_reach() results:\")\\n        print(reach_results)\\n        ```\\n\n    *   Provide *all* necessary data for storage:\\\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric (`okr_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_metrics`. The code must be validated (executed and returning non-zero values for at least 3 days.)\\\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric's reach (`okr_reach_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_reach`. The code must be validated.\\\n        *   Executed SQL queries used to produce the OKR (as a single concatenated string, separated by newline characters \\\\n).\\\n        *   Suggested `okr_name` (string).\\\n        *   Suggested `okr_description` (string).\\\n        *   Suggested `trajectory` (string).\\\n        * Ensure you use the correct datatypes in storage. Dates must be strings.\\\n\n5.  **OKR Creation and Storage (Trigger `okr_store_group`):**\n\n    *   Only when *all* data is prepared, code functions are defined and their output validated, and after you have all information printed to the console output, explicitly communicate with the next group. To do this, send *exactly* this message to `okr_store_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.` (No markdown, no backticks.)\\\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must go *first*. All data for storage comes from this agent.\\\n    * The python analyst must validate the data, and verify and print code output *before* sending it to the next group. OKR creation and storage are *not* complete unless explicitly stored.\n\nThis question should initiate the task, and the `okr_python_analyst` will respond first. The python analyst must answer the question by finding the data through queries. It should not output a response that does not answer the question and that is not a tool call.\n\nNotes to follow based on previous executions:\nBelow are updated, focused notes with new directions for each agent. These notes emphasize balancing exploration (to gain additional insights) with exploitation (using our already validated metric) and support future conversations:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nKey Updated Insights & Overall Direction:\n\u2022 Our \u201cOverall Funnel Conversion Rate on Mobile Non\u2010Quiz Pages\u201d metric is now validated. It is calculated as the ratio of funnel events with a valid next_url (after excluding quiz pages) to total funnel events\u2014grouped daily. Daily reach (unique sessions) is also tracked.\n\u2022 Qualitative insights from heatmap and element analyses (e.g. on key CTA links like \u201cTreatments\u201d) highlight potential friction in mobile navigation. This suggests that additional segmentation (by device and referrer) can refine our understanding.\n\u2022 All output is audited via SQL queries (ensuring correct date ranges and proper string formatting) and Python functions. Future efforts must maintain traceability and avoid estimation.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nNew Directions for Each Agent:\n\nPython Analyst:\n\u2022 Exploitation:\n\u2003\u2013 Continue to refine and document segmentation queries. For instance, incorporate filtering by device type (mobile) or specific referral sources (utm_source/utm_medium) to understand which mobile pages contribute most to conversions.\n\u2003\u2013 Leverage the already working conversion metric and explore how it might vary when split by major non\u2010quiz URLs beyond the homepage (e.g. \u201cTreatments,\u201d \u201cYour Plan Promo,\u201d etc.).\n\u2022 Exploration:\n\u2003\u2013 Experiment with parameterizing queries to quickly switch between segmentation dimensions (device type, referral channels, etc.). This will help gauge which segments show the highest variability.\n\u2003\u2013 Investigate additional attributes (such as session duration or browser/device characteristics) that might influence the conversion rate.\n\u2003\u2013 Consider running comparative queries between mobile and desktop segments if time permits (even if the current focus is mobile).\n\nBehavioral Analyst:\n\u2022 Exploitation:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate and document a list of candidate CTAs and navigational elements on high\u2010traffic non\u2010quiz pages (e.g. the homepage). Continue using get_top_pages and get_element to confirm valid xpaths.\n\u2003\u2013 Use get_heatmap on these key elements to verify user engagement levels.\n\u2022 Exploration:\n\u2003\u2013 Identify potential friction points on mobile pages beyond the \u201cTreatments\u201d link. Consider extracting more elements (e.g. \u201cJoin Now,\u201d \u201cBook Your Call,\u201d \u201cOur Plans\u201d) and comparing their heatmap data.\n\u2003\u2013 Collaborate closely with the Python Analyst by mapping high\u2013conversion pages to their qualitative performance. This will clarify which design changes need testing.\n\u2003\u2013 Evaluate whether additional mobile-oriented behavioral metrics (scroll depth, time on page, click dwell time) could supplement the conversion metric.\n\nOKR Store Agent:\n\u2022 Exploitation:\n\u2003\u2013 Stand ready to store validated OKR data once explicitly triggered.\n\u2003\u2013 Continue to perform strict data type verification on every field (ensuring all dates remain strings and that text passages are nonempty).\n\u2022 Exploration:\n\u2003\u2013 No new exploration is needed at this stage; preserve focus on ensuring correct data is stored.\n\u2003\u2013 If future refinements emerge (e.g., new fields or segmentation details), be prepared to verify and report any discrepancies during storage.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFuture Conversation Focus:\n\u2022 Discuss refined segmentation outputs from the Python Analyst (e.g. conversion rates split by mobile device type or referral source) to pinpoint the most actionable pages.\n\u2022 Review qualitative findings from the Behavioral Analyst regarding specific CTA friction and navigation issues. These insights will then drive design and A/B testing recommendations.\n\u2022 Integrate both quantitative segmentation and behavioral analysis to iterate on future OKRs (for instance, by testing changes to key mobile elements based on real-time conversion results).\n\nThese updated notes ensure every agent is aligned toward balancing exploration of new segmentation parameters and exploiting the already validated metric to drive further actionable insights for OKR refinement.", "source": "user"}, {"message": "\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\n\n\nBusiness Context:\nNot interested in any suggestions related to the quiz.

The python analyst must answer the question by finding the data through queries. It should not output a response that does not answer the question and that is not a tool call.\n\nNotes to follow based on previous executions:\nHere's an updated version of the notes, incorporating the new chat history and focusing on actionable directions for each agent:\n\n**Key Exploration Findings and Next Tasks \\u2013 Updated:**\n\n1.  **Data & Metric Validation Recap:**\n\n    *   Initial data validation confirmed substantial activity: sessions (\\u22485,171), funnel events (\\u224846,920), and heatmap clicks (\\u224824,480) over the last 7 days.\n    *   Initial exploration focused on the search page (\"https://carpenterjames.com/search\").\n    *   Attempts to define a \"Category Page Conversion Rate\" and \"Homepage Conversion Rate\" initially yielded zero values, indicating issues with the URL used or the conversion definition.\n    *   A broader \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" metric (ratio of funnel events with a `next_url` to total funnel events) was successfully defined and validated, returning non-zero, variable daily values. This indicates a working metric definition.\n    *   The corresponding `calculate_reach` function also returns valid, non-zero data.\n\n2.  **New Directions for Each Agent:**\n\n    *   **Python Analyst:**\n        *   Exploit the validated \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" metric. This is now the primary focus.\n        *     Since the initial attempts for specific page conversions (category and homepage) resulted in all zero values that should be investiaged, the next focus should be on identifying the correct URL.\n        *     Begin exploring segmentation of the \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\". Good starting points include:\n            *   **By `base_url`:**  Instead of focusing on a single, potentially incorrect, URL, examine the conversion rates of the *top* `base_url` values from the `funnels` table. This will reveal which pages are actually contributing to conversions (and which aren't).\n            *   **By device type (`device_form` in `sessions`):**  Understand if conversion rates differ significantly between desktop, mobile, and tablet users.  This requires joining the `funnels` table with the `sessions` table on `session_id`.\n            *   **By referrer (`utm_source`, `utm_medium` in `sessions`):** Identify which marketing channels are driving the most (and least) effective traffic.\n        *   Refine and document SQL query logic for each segmentation, ensuring auditability. Update `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` to accept segmentation parameters (e.g., `device_type`, `utm_source`). Ensure all queries and function outputs remain traceable.\n        *   Thoroughly comment the SQL queries, explaining the logic behind each segment.\n        *    Switch homepage queries to use 'http://carpenterjames.com'\n\n    *   **Behavioral Analyst:**\n        *   Once the Python Analyst identifies high-traffic `base_url` values with significant conversion rates (or significant *lack* of conversion), perform qualitative analysis:\n            *   Use `get_element` to validate XPaths for key elements (CTAs, navigation links, product links) on those pages.  *Always* validate XPaths before using `get_heatmap`.\n            *   Use `get_heatmap` (with validated XPaths and `type=1` for clicks) to analyze user interaction patterns on those key pages.\n            *   Focus on identifying friction points:\n                *   Are users clicking on expected elements?\n                *   Are there areas of high click activity that *don't* lead to conversions?\n                *   Are there key elements that are being *ignored*?\n            *   Provide specific, actionable feedback to the Python Analyst, linking observations to URLs and XPaths. This feedback should inform further segmentation and metric refinement.\n\n    *   **OKR Store Agent:**\n        *   Standby.  Do *not* attempt to store any OKR data until explicitly triggered by the Python Analyst with the *exact* required phrase, *and* after the Python Analyst has validated the output of the `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions.\n        *   When triggered, perform strict data type validation on *all* provided fields (name, description, trajectory, queries, code, reach_code, start_date, end_date) *before* calling `store_okr`.  Report any validation failures *specifically*.\n        *   Do *not* attempt to correct any data errors. Only report them.\n\n**Future Conversation Focus:**\n\n*   **Review top converting `base_url` values:** Discuss which pages are driving conversions and which are not. This will guide the Behavioral Analyst's work.\n*   **Discuss segmentation results:** Analyze how conversion rates differ by device type and referrer. This will inform optimization strategies.\n*   **Iterate on metric definition:** Based on the qualitative analysis and segmentation results, consider refining the \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" metric further (e.g., by adding additional filtering criteria).\n*   **Coordinate quantitative and qualitative findings:** Ensure that the Python Analyst's data analysis is informed by the Behavioral Analyst's observations, and vice-versa.\n\nKey Changes and Rationale:\n\n*   **Shifted focus to \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\":**  This metric is working and provides a good baseline.  We can refine it later.\n*   **Prioritized `base_url` segmentation:** This is crucial for identifying *which* pages are contributing to conversions (or not).  It's more valuable than segmenting by device or referrer *before* knowing which pages matter.\n*   **Emphasized XPath validation:**  The Behavioral Analyst *must* validate XPaths with `get_element` before using `get_heatmap`.\n*   **Reinforced OKR Store Agent's role:**  Strict adherence to the trigger phrase and data validation is critical.\n*   **Added specific SQL query suggestions:** The Python Analyst has concrete starting points for segmentation.\n*  **Specified that Python analyst switch to correct homepage.**\n*    **Simplified the suggested OKR description, since the current one is very general**\n\nThis revised set of notes prioritizes actionable steps, addresses previous errors, and promotes a more focused and iterative approach to OKR development.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat unique, relevant, and useful OKR can we track on the website by exploring the data and discovering meaningful, *measurable* metrics that align with business objectives and where there is data available? Provide the Python code necessary to calculate these metrics, ensuring all insights are auditable, traceable, and derived directly from database queries without estimation or judgment calls.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1.  **Data Validation (Mandatory First Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**\n\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must first define `start_date` (6 days before yesterday using format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"), `end_date` (yesterday's date using format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"), and `stream_key` in *every* code block.\n    *   Query for non-zero counts of, at minimum, sessions, funnel events and heatmap events using `run_sitewiz_query`. Print the results of each query.\n    *   If *any* of these counts are zero, output \"NO DATA\" and terminate. Do not proceed to analysis if no data is available for the last 7 days.\n\n2.  **Data Exploration (Mandatory Second Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**\n\n    *   If data validation is successful (all counts non-zero), explore the available data using `run_sitewiz_query` to *discover* potential metrics; do NOT immediately jump to defining an OKR.\n    *   Output *raw* query results (using the `print()` command, and limited to 10 results using `LIMIT 10`) *before* writing any `calculate_metrics` or `calculate_reach` functions. Start with simple queries like listing URLs from `funnels` or `heatmaps` (e.g. `SELECT DISTINCT base_url FROM funnels LIMIT 10`) to get a feel for the available data.\n    *   Prioritize metrics that show significant change over time (variability), impact a large number of sessions (high reach), and align with the business objectives (provided in the context).\\\n    *   The python analyst should begin with broad queries to explore the structure and types of data available.\n\n3. **Qualitative Analysis (by `insights_behavioral_analyst` - Optional, but highly encouraged):**\n\n        * Once you find a promising direction (e.g. a specific URL and a potential trend), the `insights_behavioral_analyst` *may* provide additional context, by analyzing heatmaps and session recordings. But only *after* you've provided initial data.\\\n        * The `insights_behavioral_analyst` *must* wait for a URL from the `okr_python_analyst` (derived from successful data validation and exploration) before starting its analysis. *Do not run any tools until a url is provided.*\\\n\n4.  **OKR Definition and Code Generation (by `okr_python_analyst`, only AFTER data validation and exploration, and optional qualitative analysis):**\n\n    *   Define `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions *only after* a promising metric and supporting data have been found.\\\n    *   These functions *must* return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days when executed. *Print* the output of these functions after defining them to verify their correctness. Use the following structure for calling and printing:\\\n        ```python\\n        metrics_results = calculate_metrics(start_date, end_date)\\n        print(\"calculate_metrics() results:\")\\n        print(metrics_results)\\n\\n        reach_results = calculate_reach(start_date, end_date)\\n        print(\"calculate_reach() results:\")\\n        print(reach_results)\\n        ```\\n\n    *   Provide *all* necessary data for storage:\\\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric (`okr_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_metrics`. The code must be validated (executed and returning non-zero values for at least 3 days.)\\\n        *   Python code for calculating the metric's reach (`okr_reach_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_reach`. The code must be validated.\\\n        *   Executed SQL queries used to produce the OKR (as a single concatenated string, separated by newline characters \\\\n).\\\n        *   Suggested `okr_name` (string).\\\n        *   Suggested `okr_description` (string).\\\n        *   Suggested `trajectory` (string).\\\n        * Ensure you use the correct datatypes in storage. Dates must be strings.\\\n\n5.  **OKR Creation and Storage (Trigger `okr_store_group`):**\n\n    *   Only when *all* data is prepared, code functions are defined and their output validated, and after you have all information printed to the console output, explicitly communicate with the next group. To do this, send *exactly* this message to `okr_store_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.` (No markdown, no backticks.)\\\n    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must go *first*. All data for storage comes from this agent.\\\n    * The python analyst must validate the data, and verify and print code output *before* sending it to the next group. OKR creation and storage are *not* complete unless explicitly stored.\n\nThis question should initiate the task, and the `okr_python_analyst` will respond first. The python analyst must answer the question by finding the data through queries. It should not output a response that does not answer the question and that is not a tool call.\n\nNotes to follow based on previous executions:\nBelow are updated, focused notes with new directions for each agent. These notes emphasize balancing exploration (to gain additional insights) with exploitation (using our already validated metric) and support future conversations:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nKey Updated Insights & Overall Direction:\n\u2022 Our \u201cOverall Funnel Conversion Rate on Mobile Non\u2010Quiz Pages\u201d metric is now validated. It is calculated as the ratio of funnel events with a valid next_url (after excluding quiz pages) to total funnel events\u2014grouped daily. Daily reach (unique sessions) is also tracked.\n\u2022 Qualitative insights from heatmap and element analyses (e.g. on key CTA links like \u201cTreatments\u201d) highlight potential friction in mobile navigation. This suggests that additional segmentation (by device and referrer) can refine our understanding.\n\u2022 All output is audited via SQL queries (ensuring correct date ranges and proper string formatting) and Python functions. Future efforts must maintain traceability and avoid estimation.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nNew Directions for Each Agent:\n\nPython Analyst:\n\u2022 Exploitation:\n\u2003\u2013 Continue to refine and document segmentation queries. For instance, incorporate filtering by device type (mobile) or specific referral sources (utm_source/utm_medium) to understand which mobile pages contribute most to conversions.\n\u2003\u2013 Leverage the already working conversion metric and explore how it might vary when split by major non\u2010quiz URLs beyond the homepage (e.g. \u201cTreatments,\u201d \u201cYour Plan Promo,\u201d etc.).\n\u2022 Exploration:\n\u2003\u2013 Experiment with parameterizing queries to quickly switch between segmentation dimensions (device type, referral channels, etc.). This will help gauge which segments show the highest variability.\n\u2003\u2013 Investigate additional attributes (such as session duration or browser/device characteristics) that might influence the conversion rate.\n\u2003\u2013 Consider running comparative queries between mobile and desktop segments if time permits (even if the current focus is mobile).\n\nBehavioral Analyst:\n\u2022 Exploitation:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate and document a list of candidate CTAs and navigational elements on high\u2010traffic non\u2010quiz pages (e.g. the homepage). Continue using get_top_pages and get_element to confirm valid xpaths.\n\u2003\u2013 Use get_heatmap on these key elements to verify user engagement levels.\n\u2022 Exploration:\n\u2003\u2013 Identify potential friction points on mobile pages beyond the \u201cTreatments\u201d link. Consider extracting more elements (e.g. \u201cJoin Now,\u201d \u201cBook Your Call,\u201d \u201cOur Plans\u201d) and comparing their heatmap data.\n\u2003\u2013 Collaborate closely with the Python Analyst by mapping high\u2013conversion pages to their qualitative performance. This will clarify which design changes need testing.\n\u2003\u2013 Evaluate whether additional mobile-oriented behavioral metrics (scroll depth, time on page, click dwell time) could supplement the conversion metric.\n\nOKR Store Agent:\n\u2022 Exploitation:\n\u2003\u2013 Stand ready to store validated OKR data once explicitly triggered.\n\u2003\u2013 Continue to perform strict data type verification on every field (ensuring all dates remain strings and that text passages are nonempty).\n\u2022 Exploration:\n\u2003\u2013 No new exploration is needed at this stage; preserve focus on ensuring correct data is stored.\n\u2003\u2013 If future refinements emerge (e.g., new fields or segmentation details), be prepared to verify and report any discrepancies during storage.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFuture Conversation Focus:\n\u2022 Discuss refined segmentation outputs from the Python Analyst (e.g. conversion rates split by mobile device type or referral source) to pinpoint the most actionable pages.\n\u2022 Review qualitative findings from the Behavioral Analyst regarding specific CTA friction and navigation issues. These insights will then drive design and A/B testing recommendations.\n\u2022 Integrate both quantitative segmentation and behavioral analysis to iterate on future OKRs (for instance, by testing changes to key mobile elements based on real-time conversion results).\n\nThese updated notes ensure every agent is aligned toward balancing exploration of new segmentation parameters and exploiting the already validated metric to drive further actionable insights for OKR refinement.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\npython_analysts: Python Analyst who writes and executes Python code to retrieve and analyze data using provided functions (can perform analytics calculations, segmentations, and xPath calculations).\nbehavioral_analyst: Role: Insights Behavioral Analyst\nResponsibilities: Analyze user behavior data, focusing on heatmaps and session recordings, to identify patterns, usability issues, and optimization opportunities. Prioritize your analysis by first using `get_top_pages` to identify high-traffic pages and valid URLs. Then, for relevant pages *provided by the `python_analyst`*, use `get_heatmap` to analyze *click* heatmaps. You do not generate OKRs or store data yourself. The insights behavioral analyst fits into the INSIGHTS task workflows by providing qualitative analysis to refine quantitative findings that the `python_analyst` finds from the database and then providing qualitative insights back to the python analyst.\nAvailable Tools: `get_heatmap`, `get_element`, `get_top_pages`, `get_session_recording_videos`\nokr_store: OKR storer which properly stores the OKR. They must store the OKR once the information is there.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nGIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n\u2022 Business objectives for the next 1\u20136 months include increasing conversions and increasing CAC\u2014with CAC being the higher priority.\n\u2022 Key OKRs to track are increasing average order value (AOV), boosting customer lifetime value (CLV), and enhancing click-through rates (CTR).\n\u2022 The site should convey a trustworthy and easy-to-use tone, with a focus on non-quiz parts of the site, primarily on improving funnels.\n\u2022 The competitive landscape includes Hims, Henry Meds, Join Found, Ro, and Maximus; Fella Health differentiates itself by targeting busy men over 40 (fathers) and offering a 6-month money-back guarantee, straightforward pricing, and free health coaching.\n\u2022 The domain provided is https://www.fellahealth.com/.\n\u2022 Current services include compounded Semaglutide and Tirzepatide (with Tirzepatide being in transition), along with plans to introduce branded medication (Ozempic, Wegovy), TRT treatments, and longevity products (NAD+, Rapamycin, Metformin), plus registered dietitians.\n\u2022 The OKR process involves defining start_date (6 days before yesterday) and end_date (yesterday) in \u201cYYYY-MM-DD\u201d format, and running queries to validate non-zero counts for sessions, funnel events, and heatmap events.\n\nFACTS TO LOOK UP\n\u2022 The actual counts for sessions, funnel events, and heatmap events over the past seven days would be retrieved from the site\u2019s analytics (via run_sitewiz_query).\n\u2022 Detailed performance metrics or segmentation details (e.g., conversion rates by device type or referral source) may need to be looked up from Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, or similar analytics tools referenced.\n\nFACTS TO DERIVE\n\u2022 The appropriate start_date and end_date based on \u201c6 days before yesterday\u201d and \u201cyesterday\u201d using the current date.\n\u2022 Specific SQL aggregation results and conversion rate metrics based on funnel events with valid next_url values, segmented by base_url or device type.\n\u2022 Daily conversion metrics and reach metrics (unique sessions) derived from the available query data over the determined date range.\n\u2022 Segmentation outcomes (such as conversion rates by mobile non-quiz pages) that balance high variability and extensive session coverage in alignment with business objectives.\n\nEDUCATED GUESSES\n\u2022 It is likely that the non-quiz funnel pages will show more actionable variability compared to the quiz pages, based on the emphasis in the context.\n\u2022 The provided business differentiation (money-back guarantee, transparent pricing, free health coaching) could imply that these strengths lead to higher trust and therefore better conversion rates, especially on mobile devices.\n\u2022 The eventual removal of Tirzepatide and addition of branded medications may temporarily shift some conversion metrics, suggesting that a data-driven, adaptable OKR will be key to tracking these changes.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n\u2022 Begin with data validation: \n  \u2013 Define start_date (6 days before yesterday) and end_date (yesterday) in \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format.\n  \u2013 Run queries using run_sitewiz_query to ensure non-zero counts for sessions, funnel events, and heatmap events; if any count is zero, output \"NO DATA\" and terminate.\n\n\u2022 Data exploration by the Python Analyst:\n  \u2013 Query and output a limited list (LIMIT 10) of distinct base_url values from the funnels table to understand the structure and traffic distribution.\n  \u2013 Focus on non-quiz base URLs, specifically targeting mobile pages given the business priority on mobile conversion rates.\n  \u2013 Run segmentation queries (e.g., by device type or referral source) to assess conversion rate variability across these pages.\n\n\u2022 Identify promising metrics:\n  \u2013 Analyze the \"Overall Funnel Conversion Rate\" by calculating the ratio of funnel events with a valid next_url (excluding quiz pages) to total funnel events.\n  \u2013 For reach metrics, extract unique session counts for the corresponding folders.\n  \u2013 Confirm that the metric shows non-zero, variable, daily data over at least 3 days in the past week.\n\n\u2022 Engage the Behavioral Analyst:\n  \u2013 Provide candidate high-traffic non-quiz URLs from the exploration phase that have significant funnel events or conversion variability.\n  \u2013 Request qualitative analysis on these pages using get_top_pages and get_heatmap to review click patterns, identify potential friction points, and validate key CTA elements.\n\n\u2022 Define OKR calculation functions:\n  \u2013 After acquiring both quantitative and qualitative insights, have the Python Analyst write and validate two functions:\n    \u2022 calculate_metrics(start_date, end_date): returns daily conversion rate values.\n    \u2022 calculate_reach(start_date, end_date): returns daily unique session counts.\n  \u2013 Print and validate the outputs of these functions to confirm non-zero, variable data over the last 7 days.\n\n\u2022 Finalize the OKR data:\n  \u2013 Consolidate the executed SQL queries (as a single concatenated string), the Python code (okr_code and okr_reach_code), and proposed metadata including okr_name, okr_description, and trajectory.\n  \u2013 Once all data and outputs are prepared, communicate with okr_store by sending the exact trigger message for storage.\n\nThis plan leverages both quantitative data exploration and qualitative behavioral insights to define a measurable, actionable OKR aligned with the business objectives.\n", "source": "MagenticOneOrchestrator"}, {"message": "Please define the start_date (6 days before yesterday), end_date (yesterday) in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, and stream_key.

I am also unable to get valid XPaths with `get_element` to use heatmaps, which limits my ability to provide direct, tool-based qualitative feedback.\n\nGiven these constraints, I must rely on general best practices and the existing quantitative data to provide recommendations. Since the mobile conversion rate on the join-now page is consistently zero, it's likely there's a fundamental issue with tracking or the user experience on that page.\n\nHere are my recommendations:\n\n1.  **Verify Funnel Tracking:** Double-check that funnel events are correctly implemented and firing on the \"join-now\" page, particularly for mobile users. Ensure that the `next_url` is being populated correctly when users take the desired action (e.g., clicking a CTA button). It's possible that the events are firing, but the `next_url` is missing, leading to the zero conversion rate.\n2.  **Simplify the Mobile User Flow:** Review the \"join-now\" page on a mobile device and assess the user flow. Are the steps clear and intuitive? Are there too many steps or unnecessary form fields? Consider simplifying the process to reduce friction.\n3.  **Improve CTA Visibility and Clarity:** Ensure that the CTAs on the \"join-now\" page are prominent, visually appealing, and clearly communicate the value proposition. Test different CTA copy and placements to see what performs best.\n4.  **Optimize Page Load Speed:** Mobile users are particularly sensitive to page load speed. Optimize images, reduce HTTP requests, and leverage browser caching to ensure that the page loads quickly and provides a smooth user experience.\n5.  **Consider A/B Testing:** Once the tracking issues are resolved, implement A/B testing to experiment with different variations of the \"join-now\" page and identify which changes lead to the highest conversion rates.\n\nSince I cannot use heatmaps or session recordings to provide more specific feedback, I recommend focusing on these foundational improvements to address the zero conversion rate and improve the mobile user experience on the \"join-now\" page. I will relay these suggestions back to the python analyst.\n", "source": "behavioral_analyst"}, {"message": "Based on the current findings (zero conversion rate on the join-now page despite high mobile reach), please provide actionable qualitative recommendations on how to adjust tracking parameters and optimize CTA/navigation design to better capture conversion events. Your insights should focus on potential improvements in user experience and tracking instrumentation that could drive measurable conversion rate changes.", "source": "MagenticOneOrchestrator"}, {"message": "Given the zero conversion rate on the \"join-now\" page, and my inability to use tools like heatmaps and session recordings, I can offer the following qualitative recommendations based on best practices and likely problem areas:\n\n**Tracking Adjustments:**\n\n1.  **Verify Correct Event Firing:** Use your analytics platform (Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity) to confirm that funnel events are indeed firing when users interact with CTAs and navigation elements on the \"join-now\" page, *especially* on mobile devices. Filter your analytics data specifically for mobile users and look for events associated with clicks on the \"join-now\" button or other key actions.\n2.  **Examine Event Properties:** If events are firing, carefully examine the properties associated with those events. Is the `next_url` property being populated correctly? Are there any other properties that might indicate why the conversion isn't being recorded? Perhaps the event is being attributed to the wrong page, or there's a data type mismatch.\n3.  **Implement Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking:** If you are selling a product or service on the \"join-now\" page, consider implementing enhanced ecommerce tracking in Google Analytics. This will provide more detailed insights into the user's purchase journey, including product impressions, add-to-carts, checkout steps, and purchases.\n4.  **Check for Cross-Domain Tracking Issues:** If the \"join-now\" page redirects users to a different domain to complete the purchase, ensure that you have properly configured cross-domain tracking in your analytics platform. This will prevent the user's session from being broken and ensure that the conversion is attributed to the correct source.\n5.  **Review Event Naming Conventions:** Ensure that your event naming conventions are consistent and clear. This will make it easier to analyze your data and identify any issues with tracking.\n\n**CTA and Navigation Design Optimization:**\n\n1.  **Simplify the User Flow:** Analyze the steps a user must take on the \"join-now\" page to complete the desired action (e.g., sign up for a free trial, create an account, make a purchase). Identify any unnecessary steps or form fields and remove them. The fewer steps a user has to take, the higher the likelihood of conversion.\n2.  **Make CTAs More Prominent:** Ensure that the CTAs on the \"join-now\" page are visually prominent and stand out from the surrounding content. Use contrasting colors, larger font sizes, and clear, concise copy. Consider using directional cues (e.g., arrows) to draw the user's attention to the CTAs.\n3.  **Improve CTA Copy:** Test different CTA copy to see what resonates best with your target audience. Use action-oriented language that clearly communicates the value proposition (e.g., \"Start Your Free Trial Now,\" \"Get Instant Access,\" \"Join Our Community\").\n4.  **Optimize for Mobile:** Given that the conversion rate is zero for mobile users, it's crucial to optimize the \"join-now\" page for mobile devices. Ensure that the page is responsive, loads quickly, and is easy to navigate on a small screen. Use large, touch-friendly buttons and minimize the amount of scrolling required.\n5.  **Provide Clear Value Proposition:** Make sure the value proposition of joining or signing up is immediately clear on the \"join-now\" page. What benefits will users receive? What problems will you solve for them? Use compelling visuals and concise copy to communicate the value proposition effectively.\n6.  **Use Social Proof:** Include social proof elements on the \"join-now\" page, such as testimonials, reviews, or case studies. This will help build trust and credibility and encourage users to take action.\n7.  **Remove Distractions:** Eliminate any unnecessary distractions from the \"join-now\" page, such as excessive advertising, irrelevant links, or confusing navigation. The goal is to keep the user focused on the primary action: converting.\n8.  **Test Different Layouts and Designs:** Use A/B testing to experiment with different layouts, designs, and content arrangements on the \"join-now\" page. Test different headlines, images, and form placements to see what yields the highest conversion rates.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you can improve the user experience on the \"join-now\" page, address potential tracking issues, and ultimately drive measurable changes in the mobile conversion rate.

Specifically, explain why the conversion events might still be zero despite the revised TRIM-based tracking condition, and suggest further instrumentation changes or UX improvements that could help capture conversion events more accurately.", "source": "MagenticOneOrchestrator"}, {"message": "The `tracking_results` show some `valid_next_url` events, but only a small number (1-2 per day when they occur). However, after updating the query and applying `TRIM`, the `calculate_metrics` still results in a 0.0 conversion rate. Here's a breakdown of why this might be happening and what further steps can be taken:\n\n**Possible Reasons for Zero Conversion Rate (Despite TRIM):**\n\n1.  **Mobile-Specific Tracking Issues:** The mobile conversion rate is calculated using `s.device_form = 2`. There might be a problem *specific* to mobile devices that prevents the `next_url` from being populated correctly. This could be due to JavaScript errors, incorrect event listeners, or issues with the mobile version of the website.\n2.  **Incorrect Event Trigger:** The funnel events might be triggered at the wrong time or on the wrong element. For example, the event might be triggered when the page *loads* rather than when the user *clicks* a CTA.\n3.  **`next_url` Not Reflecting Conversion:** Even if `next_url` is populated, it might not be the correct URL that indicates a successful conversion. The `next_url` might be pointing to an intermediate page or a page that doesn't represent a desired outcome.\n4.  **Sessionization Problems:** There may be issues with how the session is being tracked between different parts of the site. If the session isn't properly maintained, the `session_id` might be lost, leading to the funnel event not being associated with the initial page visit.\n5. **Base URL issues**: The base URL might be incorrect, and the events and sessions that I think are happening on https://www.fellahealth.com/join-now are not really happening on that url.\n6. **Data delays:** It is possible that the funnel events are delayed compared to session recordings, and therefore they are not recorded on the correct dates.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Deep Dive into Mobile Event Tracking:** Use your analytics platform's debugging tools (e.g., Google Analytics Debugger) to inspect the events firing on the \"join-now\" page on a *real* mobile device. Verify that the events are triggered correctly, that the `next_url` property is being populated with the expected value, and that there are no JavaScript errors.\n2.  **Validate the `next_url` Value:** Confirm that the `next_url` value being captured actually represents a successful conversion. If the goal is for users to complete a signup process, the `next_url` should point to a confirmation page or a thank-you page.\n3.  **Check Event Listeners:** Make sure the event listeners on the CTAs are properly configured to capture user clicks. Use JavaScript to log the event data to the console when a user clicks a CTA.\n4. **Investigate Base URLs:** Check the actual `base_url` values in the `funnels` table to ensure that they match exactly to 'https://www.fellahealth.com/join-now'. There may be slight variations in how the URL is recorded that are preventing events from being matched.\n5.  **Adjust Event Trigger:** If the funnel events are not being triggered at the right time, adjust the event trigger to capture the user's action more accurately. For example, trigger the event when the user clicks a CTA button rather than when the page loads.\n6. **Consider alternative Funnel Completion Metric**: Given the difficulty in capturing next_url and the current data structure available, it might be worth considering an alternative funnel completion metric such as 'submit' button clicks or successful form submission events.\n7.  **Review Sessionization Logic:** Work with your development team to review the sessionization logic and ensure that the `session_id` is being maintained correctly across all pages and domains involved in the conversion process.\n8. **Investigate time delays:** Perform a query to evaluate any time delays between session recordings and funnel events, as well as a query to determine if the events happen at all on the \"next page\" after \"join-now\".\n\nWithout direct access to the website or the tracking implementation, I can only offer these general recommendations. The key is to thoroughly investigate the mobile event tracking, validate the `next_url` value, and ensure that the session is being maintained correctly. It's possible that a combination of these factors is contributing to the zero conversion rate.\n\nGiven these additional steps, I will pass this back to the `python_analyst`.\n", "source": "behavioral_analyst"}, {"message": "Please provide additional qualitative insights explaining why the conversion events might still be zero, and suggest further instrumentation or UX improvements that could help capture conversion events more accurately.", "source": "MagenticOneOrchestrator"}, {"message": "I am unable to provide more detailed analysis since I cannot validate XPaths, get heatmaps, session recordings, or other information from the website.

This situation could be explained by several factors:\n\n1. Mobile event triggers might not be firing correctly on the join-now page\u2014this could be due to mobile-specific JavaScript errors or improper event listener configurations that prevent the CTA click events from being recorded, especially if the event is not firing at the correct moment (e.g., on click rather than on page load).\n\n2. Even when next_url values are captured, they may not actually correspond to a conversion. For example, they might represent an intermediate step that isn\u2019t being used as a signal of a true progression in the funnel.\n\n3. There could be a base_url mismatch in the tracking data. The events we expect on the join-now page might be recorded under a slightly different URL (e.g., due to different capitalization, trailing slashes, or URL parameters), so our strict filter on base_url might be excluding valid conversion events.\n\n4. Sessionization issues might be causing the link between funnel events and the actual user session to be lost. If mobile sessions are not maintained consistently (for example, due to page reloads or cookies being cleared), conversion events may not be matched to the correct session.\n\nGiven these issues, further instrumentation or UX improvements are recommended:\n- **Improve Mobile Event Triggering:** Inspect the mobile version of the join-now page (using tools like the Google Analytics Debugger or mobile browser developer tools) to ensure that event listeners on CTAs are firing at the correct time. Check for JavaScript errors that may prevent tracking.\n- **Validate and Standardize the Base URL:** Audit the recorded base_url values in the funnels table to ensure that they match the intended join-now URL exactly. If there are slight variations (e.g., with trailing slashes or query parameters), you may need to update the tracking logic to normalize these URLs.\n- **Reconsider the Conversion Event Definition:** Instead of relying solely on the next_url field, consider capturing additional or alternative events\u2014such as button click events (or form submission events) directly\u2014in order to have a more robust and reliable indicator of conversion.\n- **Review Session Management:** Work with the development team to ensure that the mobile session is maintained consistently and that the session_id is accurately passed across pages; this will help ensure that funnel events are correctly attributed to the right sessions.\n- **Conduct A/B Testing:** Once the tracking is verified and possibly revised, set up A/B tests for different CTA designs and navigation layouts to determine which version yields a higher conversion rate.\n\nThese recommendations should be used to refine the tracking instrumentation and UX on the join-now page, so that conversion events are captured more accurately and the funnel progression is reflective of the true user behavior.", "source": "python_analyst"}, {"message": "No Python code blocks found in the most recent message.

Adjust the base URL filtering if necessary, and implement alternative\n     tracking for direct conversions (e.g., click or submission events).\n   - Collect additional data post-implementation changes to verify that conversion events are now being\n     captured more accurately, and use the updated metrics to optimize the join-now page for higher conversions.\n", "source": "code_executor"}, {"message": "These are the code blocks successfully executed:\nSource: python_analyst\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport datetime\nfrom datetime import timedelta\nfrom functions import run_sitewiz_query\nfrom typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Step 1: Validate the stream key and review base_url values in funnels table.\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------\nend_date = (datetime.datetime.now() -

It's possible the tracked `next_url` reflects navigation *within* the \"join-now\" page, rather than progression to a subsequent page that confirms a successful \"join\" or signup. This is, again, difficult to determine with the current toolset.\n2.  **JavaScript Errors**: Are there JavaScript errors that could be preventing the correct firing of the funnel events on mobile devices? A query to surface any JavaScript errors from the session recordings data might be useful. However, such a query is outside of the scope of the available tools.\n3.  **Mobile-Specific Issues**: Mobile devices can have unique challenges related to event tracking, such as inconsistent browser behavior or network connectivity problems. There might be a mobile-specific issue preventing the accurate capture of funnel events.\n\nGiven the limitations, here's what I suggest to the python analyst:\n\n1.  **Explore Alternative Conversion Metrics:** Relying solely on the `next_url` might not be the best approach. Instead, consider tracking more direct indicators of conversion, such as:\n    *   **Form Submission Events:** Track the submission of the signup form directly. This would require identifying the specific event associated with form submission (e.g., a custom event or a Google Analytics event).\n    *   **Button Clicks:** Track clicks on the primary CTA button (e.g., \"Join Now,\" \"Sign Up\"). This would at least provide a measure of user engagement with the button, even if it doesn't directly confirm a full conversion. You will need the element and then get the xpath to use the tool. However, I have not been able to get the elements with the tool.\n2.  **Verify Mobile Event Firing Directly:** Ask the development team to use debugging tools on a *real* mobile device to inspect the firing of events on the \"join-now\" page. They should confirm that the events are triggered correctly when the user interacts with the intended elements (e.g., the signup form or the CTA button).\n3. **Session Recording Review:** This may help determine where the friction points are in the session.\n4.  **Check base URLs:** I need to reiterate that this is a concern. There is some possibility that the base urls in the database do not match the base urls as I understand them.\n\nSince I am unable to perform qualitative analysis directly, I am again relying on best practices and suggesting further investigation. I will communicate this back to the python analyst.\n", "source": "behavioral_analyst"}, {"message": "Please incorporate additional segmentation (e.g., by device type nuances, referral channels, or even additional event properties) into your conversion metric queries and re-run them.

This further reinforces the idea that the issue is not source-specific but a *systemic* problem on the \"join-now\" page for mobile. It also means that the proposed OKR, which focuses on increasing conversion rate *by referral source*, may not be viable in its current form.\n\nHere are my qualitative insights and recommendations:\n\n1.  **The Problem is Not Traffic Quality**: Segmenting by `utm_source` and still seeing zero conversions suggests the *source* of the traffic is not the problem. It is something on the page itself. The python analyst should focus on mobile technical issues to solve this problem.\n2.  **Focus on Mobile-Specific Issues**: Given the consistent zero conversion rate across all referral sources, the issue is likely related to the \"join-now\" page's mobile experience, tracking implementation, or a combination of both.\n3.  **Confirm Base URL** The query results show distinct base urls like \"'file:///tmp/tmp4s0jqgez/index.html'\". Please confirm that these URLs are correct, and that the system is pointing to the correct base urls.\n4.  **Back-End Validation of Data Capture:** Since the problem persists, there might be more fundamental technical problems with how events are captured, processed, and stored in the data warehouse. This calls for a thorough validation of the entire data pipeline, from event capture to storage.\n\nGiven that my tools are not providing me the information I need, I am unable to provide additional insights, and will have to send my analysis back to the `python_analyst`. At this point, I think my participation is limited. I am not able to make further recommendations.\n", "source": "behavioral_analyst"}, {"message": "Based on our comprehensive data exploration and the insights gathered, we recommend tracking an OKR that focuses on improving the mobile funnel conversion on key non\u2010quiz pages\u2014specifically the \u201cjoin\u2010now\u201d page. Although our current tracking of the mobile conversion metric (using valid next_url events on the join\u2010now page) is returning 0, the segmentation analysis (even by referral channel) confirms that this isn\u2019t a traffic source issue. Instead, it suggests that there may be mobile\u2010specific technical or UX problems (such as misfiring event triggers, incorrect base URL capture, or timing issues with CTA clicks) that are preventing conversions from being recorded.\n\nOur proposed OKR is as follows:\n\nOKR Name:\n\u201cIncrease Mobile Conversion Rate on Join\u2010Now Page (Revised Tracking & UX Optimization)\u201d\n\nOKR Description:\n\u201cImprove the conversion performance for mobile users on the join\u2010now page by enhancing tracking instrumentation and optimizing CTA design. The primary metric is the mobile funnel conversion rate\u2014calculated as the ratio of valid funnel events (determined by a non-empty next_url, after applying TRIM to normalize values) to total funnel events\u2014for mobile sessions (device_form = 2). Although current tracking shows a zero conversion rate, this OKR will drive a thorough investigation and improvements in mobile event firing, base_url consistency, and overall user flow, ensuring that the metric reflects true user progression. Segmentation by referral channel (utm_source) will additionally help identify if certain traffic sources perform better than others once tracking and UX issues are resolved.\u201d\n\nTrajectory:\n1. Verify that the join\u2010now page\u2019s tracking is correctly implemented on mobile devices (e.g., ensuring the CTA click events fire properly, the next_url field is correctly populated, and sessionization is maintained).\n2. Collaborate with the development team to use debugging tools (such as a mobile analytics debugger) to pinpoint any mobile\u2010specific technical issues that might be leading to missed conversion events.\n3. If the next_url continues to prove unreliable as a conversion indicator, investigate alternative metrics (like direct CTA button clicks or form submissions) for measuring mobile conversions.\n4. Once tracking issues are addressed, use detailed segmentation (by referral channel, device type, etc.) to monitor daily conversion trends, and implement A/B testing to optimize CTA design and reduce friction in the conversion funnel.\n5. Use the actionable data from these efforts to refine and iterate the mobile conversion experience, aiming for measurable improvements in conversion rate over time.\n\nThe Python code we developed\u2014which includes functions like calculate_metrics and calculate_reach (with queries segmented by utm_source for mobile sessions on the join\u2010now page)\u2014allows us to audit and trace these metrics day-by-day over the past week. Although our current queries return a 0 conversion rate, they provide a solid baseline and a traceable audit trail that shows exactly where improvements are needed.\n\nIn summary, while our current mobile conversion rate is 0 (indicating a tracking or UX issue), this OKR will push for a focused review and optimization of mobile tracking and user experience on the join\u2010now page. This approach is directly aligned with your objectives to increase conversions and boost key performance indicators, while also ensuring that our measurements are accurate and actionable.", "source": "MagenticOneOrchestrator"}]}

- Summary: Here's an updated version of the notes, incorporating the latest chat history and focusing on actionable directions for each agent, while emphasizing the balance between exploration and exploitation and preparing for future conversations:

**Key Status & Overall Notes:**

*   **OKR Successfully Stored:** The OKR "Increase Overall Funnel Conversion Rate (Non-Quiz)" has been successfully defined, validated, and stored.  This is a major milestone.
*   **Qualitative Analysis Initiated:** The Behavioral Analyst has begun using `get_top_pages` to identify high-traffic non-quiz pages for qualitative analysis. This marks the start of the exploitation phase, where we leverage our defined metric.
*   **Metric Validation**: The okr_python_analyst created and defined the `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions and provided the OKR name, description, code and reach code to create and store the OKR.

**Agent: Python Analyst**

*   **Current Status:** Successfully defined, validated, and triggered the storage of the "Overall Funnel Conversion Rate (Non-Quiz)" OKR.  The code produced valid outputs for both `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach`.
*   **Exploitation (Primary Focus):**
    *   **Refine Segmentation:** Now that the baseline OKR is established, the Python Analyst should focus on segmenting the "Overall Funnel Conversion Rate (Non-Quiz)" to identify areas for improvement.  Prioritize these segmentations:
        *   **`base_url` Segmentation:**  Modify `calculate_metrics` to accept a `base_url` parameter.  This will allow us to calculate the conversion rate *for specific non-quiz pages*.  This is *critical* for focusing optimization efforts. The Behavioral Analyst's `get_top_pages` output will inform which `base_url` values to analyze.
        *   **Device Segmentation (`device_form`):**  Modify `calculate_metrics` to accept a `device_form` parameter (0 for Desktop, 1 for Tablet, 2 for Mobile).  This will allow us to compare conversion rates across different device types, aligning with the client's mobile focus. This requires joining with the `sessions` table.
        *     **Referral Source (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`):** Similar to the other segmentations, create parameters that allow the okr analyst to change what is being investigated.
    *   **Document SQL Queries:**  Ensure all segmentation queries are thoroughly documented, explaining the logic and purpose of each segment.
    *   **Update `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach`:**  Modify these functions to accept the segmentation parameters. The functions should still return daily values, but now those values will be specific to the segment.
*   **Exploration (Secondary - Only if time permits and segmentation doesn't reveal actionable insights):**
    *   If, after thorough segmentation, no clear areas for improvement are found, *then* consider exploring *additional* funnel event types (beyond just those with a valid `next_url`) to see if a broader definition of "conversion" reveals different patterns.  This should only be done if the primary exploitation activities are complete and inconclusive.
*   **Future Conversation Focus:**
    *   **Review Segmented Conversion Rates:**  Present the conversion rates for the top non-quiz pages (identified by the Behavioral Analyst) and for different device types.  Discuss which pages/segments show the lowest conversion rates and are therefore the highest priority for optimization.
    *   **Coordinate with Behavioral Analyst:**  Share the segmented data with the Behavioral Analyst to guide their qualitative analysis.  For example, if the "Treatments" page on mobile has a low conversion rate, the Behavioral Analyst should focus their heatmap and session recording analysis on that specific page and device combination.

**Agent: Behavioral Analyst**

*   **Current Status:**  Started using `get_top_pages` to identify high-traffic non-quiz pages.
*   **Exploitation (Primary Focus):**
    *   **Prioritize Top Pages:** Use the output of `get_top_pages` to create a prioritized list of non-quiz pages for analysis.  Focus on pages with high traffic volume. Make sure to avoid quiz pages.
    *   **Validate XPaths with `get_element`:**  For each prioritized page, use `get_element` to identify and *validate* the XPaths of key elements (CTAs, navigation links, form fields, etc.).  *Never* use `get_heatmap` without first validating XPaths.
    *   **Analyze Mobile Heatmaps with `get_heatmap`:** Use `get_heatmap` with `type=1` (clicks) and the validated XPaths to analyze user interaction on mobile devices. Focus on:
        *   **Click Distribution:** Are users clicking on the expected CTAs and navigational elements?
        *   **Friction Points:** Are there areas with high click activity that *don't* lead to a subsequent page in the funnel (as indicated by the absence of a `next_url` in the funnel data)?
        *   **Dead Clicks:** Are users clicking on non-interactive elements?
        *   **Ignored Elements:** Are key CTAs or navigational elements being ignored?
    * **Document Findings:** Capture screenshots of the heatmaps and clearly document observations, linking them to specific URLs and XPaths.
*   **Exploration (Secondary - Only if time permits and initial analysis is inconclusive):**
    *   If time permits, consider analyzing scroll heatmaps (`type=2`) to understand how far users are scrolling down the page on mobile. This can reveal if important content is being missed.
    *   If click data is minimal, consider analyzing hover heatmaps (`type=0`), though click data is generally more informative for mobile.
*   **Future Conversation Focus:**
    *   **Present Qualitative Findings:** Share the prioritized list of pages, validated XPaths, and heatmap analyses with the Python Analyst and other team members.  Clearly articulate any observed friction points, user behavior patterns, and potential areas for improvement.
    *   **Collaborate on Recommendations:**  Work with the Python Analyst to link the qualitative findings to the segmented conversion rate data.  This will inform specific, actionable recommendations for A/B testing (e.g., "The 'Book Your Call' button on the /treatments page has low click activity on mobile.  We recommend testing a different button color, label, or placement.").

**Agent: OKR Store Agent**

*   **Current Status:** Successfully stored the OKR.
*   **Immediate Actions:** None. The primary task is complete.
* **Future Conversation Focus:**
    *   Stand by in case further okrs need to be stored.

**Overall Strategy:**

1.  **Python Analyst refines segmentation:** The Python Analyst will update `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` to accept `base_url` and `device_form` parameters. They'll use these parameters to generate segmented conversion rate data.
2.  **Behavioral Analyst focuses qualitative analysis:**  The Behavioral Analyst will use the output of the Python agent, along with initial `get_top_pages` results, to prioritize their qualitative analysis. They will focus on mobile heatmaps and validating xpaths for any elements of interest
3.  **Collaborative Discussion and Recommendations:** The Python Analyst and Behavioral Analyst will share their findings, linking quantitative data (segmented conversion rates) with qualitative observations (heatmap analysis). This will lead to specific, actionable recommendations for improving conversion rates on non-quiz pages.
4.  **Iterative Improvement:** The team will use the OKR as a baseline to track the impact of implemented changes. The process will be iterative, with continuous data analysis and refinement of optimization strategies.

This revised set of notes emphasizes a clear workflow, prioritizes actionable tasks, and sets the stage for a productive discussion focused on data-driven insights and targeted optimization.

- Summary: Here's an updated version of the notes, incorporating all the feedback and focusing on the next steps for each agent. The primary goal remains getting a correctly formatted, storable OKR, but with a renewed emphasis on the `/search` page and *accurate* event tracking. The /book-your-call page is completely off the table for now, as instructed.

**Key Status Updates (for all team members):**

*   **OKR Still Not Stored:** The persistent issue is the Python Analyst not providing the output in the correct format (single Python code block followed *immediately* by the trigger string and parameters).  Conversational text, explanations, and incorrect formatting are preventing successful storage.
*   **`/search` Page is the EXCLUSIVE Focus:**  We are pivoting *entirely* to the `/search` page, leveraging existing code logic and focusing on mobile sessions.  `/book-your-call` is completely de-prioritized.
*    **Low Search Usage/Incorrect Events:** The diagnostic queries and initial metric calculations for `/search` show very low usage (often zero) and raise concerns about whether event types 3 and 4 are truly capturing search actions.  *This is now the primary area for investigation*.
*  **Incorrect Formatting:** The store agent has still not received a correctly formated string for the OKR.
* **Name Error:** Code output includes sequence_results, but this variable has been removed and is no longer available.

**Python Analyst**

*   **Current Status & Issues:**
    *   **Incorrect Output Format (Persistent):** The agent continues to include conversational text and fails to provide the output as a *single* Python code block followed *immediately* by the trigger string.  This is the *only* blocking issue at this stage.
    *   **Low/Zero Search Usage:** Even with the `base_url` correctly set to `/search`, the calculated metrics are often zero or very low, suggesting we are not capturing the relevant search events.
    * **Name Error** The agent has removed a defined variable but continues to reference it in print output.

*   **Immediate Actions (Critical - MUST FIX):**
    1.  **Output ONLY a Single Python Code Block + Trigger (ABSOLUTE FINAL ATTEMPT):** The output *must* be a single, valid, executable Python code block.  It *must* begin with the standard imports, `start_date`, `end_date`, and `stream_key` definitions.  It *must* contain  `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions *adapted for the /search page*. The code *must* be followed *immediately* (no blank lines, no comments) by the trigger string, in this *exact* format:
        ```
        okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.\nname: \"\"\"OKR Name\"\"\"\ndescription: \"\"\"OKR Description\"\"\"\ntrajectory: \"\"\"Detailed steps taken, including reasoning for choices.\"\"\"\nqueries: \"\"\"-- SQL Queries used, each on a new line\n\"\"\"\nokr_code: \"\"\"<python code string for calculate_metrics>\"\"\"\nokr_reach_code: \"\"\"<python code string for calculate_reach>\"\"\"\nstart_date: \"\"\"YYYY-MM-DD\"\"\"\nend_date: \"\"\"YYYY-MM-DD\"\"\"
        ```
        *   Use triple quotes (`"""`) for multi-line strings.
        *   Newlines within strings *must* be escaped as `\n`.
        *   The agent MUST provide the values, names and descriptions.
        *   The code inside the okr_code and okr_reach_code must be executable, and MUST NOT throw errors.

    2.  **Investigate and Identify Correct Search Event Types (HIGH PRIORITY - EXPLORATION):**  We *cannot* assume that `event_type IN (3, 4)` is correct for the `/search` page.  The agent *must* explore to determine what constitutes a "search" action.  This is now the *highest priority* after output formatting.
        *   **Query for Distinct `event_type` Values:** The agent *must* run the following query and *print the results*:
            ```python
            query_event_types = f\"\"\"\n    SELECT DISTINCT event_type, COUNT(*) AS count\n    FROM funnels\n    WHERE base_url = 'https://www.fellahealth.com/search'\n      AND stream_key = '{stream_key}'\n      AND device_form = 2  -- Focus on mobile\n      AND timestamp BETWEEN {start_ts} AND {end_ts}\n    GROUP BY event_type\n    ORDER BY count DESC;\n    \"\"\"\n            event_type_results = run_sitewiz_query(query_event_types, \"Distinct event_types on /search (mobile)\")\n            print(\"Event Type Exploration:\")\n            print(event_type_results)\n
            ```
            This query finds the distinct `event_type` values associated with the `/search` page for *mobile* sessions, along with their counts.  This will help us understand what actions are happening on the page.
        *   **Analyze and Adapt:**  Based on the results of `query_event_types`, the agent *must* determine which `event_type` values *actually represent user search actions.* It should consider the counts (higher counts are more likely to be relevant) and any available knowledge about what those event types mean.  It *must not assume* `event_type IN (3, 4)` is correct without evidence.
        *   **Update `calculate_metrics` (Numerator):** Once the relevant `event_type` values are identified, the agent *must* update the `numerator_query` within the `calculate_metrics` function to use those values in the `WHERE` clause (e.g., `AND f.event_type IN (/* ... list of relevant event types ... */)`).  *This is critical for a meaningful metric.*
            *   **Document the Chosen Event Types:**  The agent *must* clearly document, *in the `trajectory` string*, which `event_type` values it chose and *why*.  This is crucial for auditability and understanding the metric's definition.

    3.  **Refine `calculate_metrics` (After Event Type Exploration):**
        *   **`base_url`:**  Use  `f.base_url = 'https://www.fellahealth.com/search'` (as before).
        *   **`device_form`:**  Include `AND s.device_form = 2` in *both* the numerator and denominator to focus on *mobile* sessions.
        *   **Numerator:** `COUNT(DISTINCT f.session_id)` where `base_url` is correct *and* `event_type` is in the list identified in step 2.
        *   **Denominator:** `COUNT(DISTINCT s.session_id)` for *all* mobile sessions (joining `sessions` and `session_recordings`).
        *   **Ratio:** Calculate the daily ratio (numerator / denominator).
        * Remove sequence_results

    4.  **`calculate_reach` Function:**  Calculate the total number of *mobile* sessions per day.  This can be done by joining the `sessions` and `session_recordings` tables, filtering for `s.device_form = 2`, and grouping by `sr.date`. *It does not need to be specific to the /search page*. A general count of mobile sessions is sufficient for reach.

    5. **Remove Unnecessary Code:** The agent should *remove* any code related to exploring other URLs (like `/book-your-call`) or attempting to define alternative metrics until the `/search` metric is correctly implemented and stored.

*   **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation:**
    *   **Exploitation:** Getting a correctly formatted, storable OKR using the `/search` page remains the *highest* priority.
    *   **Exploration:** *Crucially*, the exploration now focuses on identifying the correct `event_type` values for the `/search` page. This is *essential* for defining a meaningful metric. The agent *must not* proceed to defining the full OKR without completing this step and documenting the findings.

*   **Future Conversation Focus:**
    *   **Immediate:**  Correct output format (single code block + trigger string). Results of the `event_type` exploration (which values were found, and why they were chosen). Validation that the `/search` metric (with the chosen event types) returns meaningful, non-zero, and varying data.
    *   **Longer-Term:**  Refinement of the metric based on further analysis, behavioral insights (once unblocked).

**Behavioral Analyst**

*   **Current Status:** Blocked.
*   **Immediate Actions:**
    *   **Wait:** Do nothing.
*   **New Directions:** None.
*   **Future Conversation Focus:** Once a valid metric (with chosen URL and event types) is stored, the Behavioral Analyst can begin qualitative analysis on the `/search` page to understand user interaction patterns.

**OKR Store Agent**

*   **Current Status:** Blocked. Has not received a correctly formatted trigger message.
*   **Immediate Actions:**
    1.  **Wait for Correct Trigger:** Do nothing until the *exact* trigger phrase is received.
    2.  **Verification (CRITICAL):**  When a message *appears* to be the trigger, verify:
        *   **Origin:** It *must* come from `okr_python_analyst` in the `okr_python_group`.
        *   **Exact Match:**  It *must* start with: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.`
        *   **Complete Parameters:**  `name`, `description`, `trajectory`, `queries`, `okr_code`, `okr_reach_code`, `start_date`, `end_date` *must* all be present and be strings.
        *   **Single String:**  The entire message (trigger + parameters) must be a single, correctly formatted string.
    3.  **Store OKR:** If all verifications pass, call `store_okr`.
    4.  **Output Result:** Report *only* the result of the `store_okr` call (success or error message).  Do not add any other text.
*   **New Directions:** None.
*   **Future Conversation Focus:** The outcome of the `store_okr` call.

**Overall Team - Next Steps:**

1.  **Python Analyst - Correct Output Format (IMMEDIATE & CRITICAL):** The example provides the *exact* required structure. No deviations.
2.  **Python Analyst - Event Type Exploration (IMMEDIATE & CRITICAL):** Run the `query_event_types` query and *analyze* the results to choose relevant event types for the `/search` metric. Document the reasoning.
3.  **Python Analyst - Refine `calculate_metrics`:**  Update the numerator to use the identified event types.
4.  **Python Analyst - Validate and Trigger:** Ensure `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` return valid data, then send the correctly formatted trigger message.
5.  **OKR Store Agent - Store:**  Verify the trigger message and store the OKR.
6.  **Behavioral Analysis (Blocked):** Remains blocked until a valid, stored OKR provides a URL for analysis.

**Key Changes and Emphasis:**

*   **Absolute Priority on `/search`:** All efforts are focused on the `/search` page.
*   **Mandatory Event Type Exploration:**  The Python Analyst *must* investigate and document the correct event types *before* finalizing the OKR.
*   **Concrete Example of Exploration:**  The `query_event_types` query is provided to guide the agent.
*   **Simplified Metric:** The metric is a simple ratio of sessions with search activity to total mobile sessions.
*   **Output Format is Non-Negotiable:** Repeated, explicit instructions on the *exact* format.
*   **No More `/book-your-call`:**  This page is completely de-prioritized.
* **Name Error Fixed:** Removed unnecesary variable reference.

The Python Analyst's output format and the identification of correct event types are *the* critical issues to address. All other tasks are secondary to these.

 
Evaluation from 2025-03-17 05:05:31:
- Type: okr
- Successes: 0 
- Attempts: 0
- Failure Reasons: []
- Summary: Here's an updated breakdown of the notes, focusing on critical issues, agent responsibilities, next steps, and a strategic shift towards finding a *storable* OKR:

**Key Status & Overall Notes:**

*   **CRITICAL FAILURE: OKR NOT STORED:** The `okr_store_agent` was *never* triggered.  The `python_analyst` repeatedly printed the trigger message *within* a code block's output, rather than sending it as a separate, plain-text message. The store agent *only* responds to that exact plain-text message.  This is the *primary* blocking issue.
*   **Data Validation:** Data validation was successful, showing non-zero data for sessions, funnels, and heatmaps.
*   **URL Exploration:** The `python_analyst` successfully identified `https://www.fellahealth.com/med-easy` as a non-quiz page with significant mobile funnel activity.
*   **Event Type Exploration:** Event types 3 and 5 were identified as relevant conversion events on the selected URL.
*   **`calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` Defined:**  The `python_analyst` defined both functions, but the calculated metrics have an issue (see below).
*    **Incorrect conversion rate**: The python analyst is calculating more than 100% for the conversion rate for one day. This is not a valid metric.
*   **Reach only has values on one day**: The reach metric is only non-zero for one day (2025-03-10), which doesn't allow any sort of trending.
*   **OKR data not prepared**: The python_analyst only outputs python, so all of the OKR data is missing from the response. The system message provides specific requirements:
    *   Python code for calculating the metric (`okr_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_metrics`. This code must be validated by running the code and confirming the output. The code *must* return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days. The `stream_key` must be hard coded. All standard imports must be included. This *must* be a complete, self-contained, executable Python *string* (use triple quotes). It *must* include all necessary imports, define a function named `calculate_metrics` that accepts `start_date: str` and `end_date: str` as arguments, and return a dictionary with the key 'values' (eg `{'values': metrics}`).  The SQL queries within `calculate_metrics` *must* correctly use the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters and the stream key must be hard coded.  The code *must* include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that *calls* `calculate_metrics` and *prints* the result so it can be validated.\
        *   Python code for calculating the metric's reach (`okr_reach_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_reach`. Must return non-zero values for at least 3 days. This code must be returned as a *complete, self-contained, executable* Python *string*.  It must include all imports, define `calculate_reach`, use the correct signature, return a dictionary with a 'values' key, define `stream_key` *within* the string, and have an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to execute and validate the function.\
        *   Executed SQL queries (as a *single, concatenated string*, with newline characters separating the different queries).\n        *   Suggested `okr_name` (string).\n        *   Suggested `okr_description` (string).\n        *   Suggested `trajectory` (detailed steps taken).

**Agent: Python Analyst**

*   **Current Status & Issues:**
    *   **OKR Data Not Provided (BLOCKING):**  The agent *did not* provide the required data (as strings) to the store agent: okr_code, okr_reach_code, queries, okr_name, okr_description, trajectory.  It *only* printed the results of its *own* function calls and some debugging information.
    *   **Incorrect Trigger Message (BLOCKING):**  The agent printed the trigger message as `print("okr_store_group, please...")` *within* the Python code.  This will *never* trigger the `okr_store_agent`. It must be a separate, top-level message.
    * **Metrics only for one day are returned**: The data being returned should change over at least 3 days.
* **Fix calculation of numerator:** In the current SQL, the numerator counts *distinct session IDs* with funnel events of type 3 or 5.  This means if a user has *both* a type 3 and a type 5 event within the *same session* on the *same day*, it's only counted *once* in the numerator. It needs to be a simple COUNT of all funnels, not DISTINCT session ids.
*   **Immediate Actions (Critical - MUST FIX):**

    1.  **Correct calculate metrics.** The numerator should be a count of the *events*, not distinct sessions.
        *   **Updated Numerator Query:**

            ```sql
            WITH numerator AS (
                SELECT sr.date AS date, COUNT(*) AS event_count
                FROM funnels f
                JOIN session_recordings sr ON f.session_id = sr.session_id
                WHERE f.base_url = '{candidate_url}'
                  AND f.stream_key = '{stream_key}'
                  AND f.event_type IN (3, 5)
                  AND sr.date BETWEEN '{start_date}' AND '{end_date}'
                GROUP BY sr.date
            )
            ```
        *   **Recalculate Denominator.** The denominator should still be calculated as the number of unique mobile sessions.
            ```sql
              denom AS (
                SELECT sr.date AS date, COUNT(DISTINCT s.session_id) AS session_count
                FROM sessions s
                JOIN session_recordings sr ON s.session_id = sr.session_id
             WHERE s.stream_key = '{stream_key}'
                AND s.device_form = 2 -- Make sure we're only counting mobile sessions
                AND sr.date BETWEEN '{start_date}' AND '{end_date}'
                AND EXISTS ( -- ensure these sessions are only ones that went on this base_url
                    SELECT 1
                    FROM funnels f
                    WHERE f.session_id = s.session_id
                    AND f.base_url = '{candidate_url}'
                )

                GROUP BY sr.date
            )

            ```

        * **Recalculate reach:** The reach query did not correctly limit to mobile only. It needs to be updated
             ```sql
                SELECT sr.date AS date, COUNT(DISTINCT s.session_id) AS reach
                FROM sessions s
                JOIN session_recordings sr on s.session_id = sr.session_id
                JOIN funnels f on s.session_id = f.session_id
                WHERE s.stream_key = '{stream_key}'
                AND s.device_form = 2 --This is what was missing.
                AND f.base_url = '{candidate_url}'
                AND sr.date BETWEEN '{start_date}' AND '{end_date}'
                GROUP BY sr.date
                ORDER BY sr.date
            ```
    2.  **Regenerate `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach`:**  The agent *must* regenerate these functions, *within a single code block*, using the corrected queries. It *must* call both functions and print their output using the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block *inside* the code string.
    3. **Validate the return of data**: The python code should be checked that it contains data and returns non-zero and non-uniform data for at least 3 days.
    4.  **Prepare OKR Data String:**  Create properly-formatted *string* variables for:
        *   `okr_code`:  The *complete, executable* Python code for `calculate_metrics`, as a string.  Include all imports.  Include a docstring.  Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to test it.  *Must* have the correct function signature.
        *   `okr_reach_code`: The *complete, executable* Python code for `calculate_reach`, as a string. Include all imports.  Include a docstring. Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to test it.  *Must* have the correct function signature.
        *   `executed_sql_queries`:  A *single* string containing *all* SQL queries used, separated by newline characters (`\n`).
        *   `okr_name`: A string.
        *   `okr_description`: A string.
        *   `trajectory`: A string (the steps taken).
    5.  **Send Correct Trigger Message:** After *all* of the above is done, send the plain-text message: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.`  *Do not* put this in a code block.

*   **Balancing Exploration/Exploitation:**
    *   **Exploitation (Primary):** The focus now is *firmly* on getting a *storable* OKR based on the `med-easy` page.  All necessary exploration has been done (URL selection, event type selection). The agent must *not* deviate to other URLs or metrics until this is complete.
    *   **Exploration (Secondary):** *After* the OKR is successfully stored, a *brief* exploration of *other* non-quiz pages could be considered, *if* time allows, and *if* the `med-easy` conversion rate shows very little variability (making it a poor OKR choice).

*   **Future Conversation Focus:**
    *   **IMMEDIATE:**  Verification that the *corrected* `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions return valid data (non-zero, varying over at least 3 days).
    *   **NEXT:** Confirmation that the `okr_store_agent` successfully stored the OKR.
    *   **LATER:** *If* the stored OKR proves to be unsuitable (e.g., no variability), *then* discuss exploring other potential non-quiz pages.

**Agent: Behavioral Analyst**

*   **Current Status:** Blocked (correctly). Waiting for data/direction from the `python_analyst`.
*   **Immediate Actions:** None. Continue to wait.
*   **Future Conversation Focus:** *After* the OKR is stored, the Behavioral Analyst could be used to provide qualitative insights into *why* the conversion rate on `med-easy` is behaving as it is.  This would inform optimization strategies.  This is *lower* priority than getting the OKR stored.

**Agent: OKR Store Agent**

*   **Current Status:** Blocked (correctly). Waiting for the trigger message.
*   **Immediate Actions:** None. Continue to wait for the *correct* trigger message from the `python_analyst`.
*   **Future Conversation Focus:**  Reporting success or failure of the `store_okr` call.  If it fails, providing the *specific* error message.

**Overall Strategy Shift:**

The overwhelming priority is to get *a* valid OKR stored, based on the already-identified `med-easy` page and event types 3 and 5.  All efforts should be focused on:

1.  **Correcting the `python_analyst`'s output.**
2.  **Triggering the `okr_store_agent` correctly.**

*Only after* this is successful should any further exploration be considered. The previous attempts failed because the agents got sidetracked with debugging and exploration *before* ensuring the basic OKR creation and storage workflow was functioning.



All Current Prompts and Versions:

Prompt: insights_user_proxy_system_message

  Version 1 (2025-03-13 13:19:22):
  Content:
  You are an insights user proxy whose role is to call 'store_insight' using the context of the previous messages to store verified insights.

All the types must match and the keys must be the same. Estimate the value if they are not provided. Don't leave any field empty, estimate them if needed.

The variable, derivation, and reference substitutions should only be for the data_statement field. The other fields should be filled in with the actual values as needed. Reference substitutions can be in variables, derivation, or data_statement.
However, all text should be human readable, eg for the data statement, you must put session ids, xpaths, etc. in variables where the human would read the 'readable' field with a tooltip of the actual value.
All calculations should use variables in the derivation field, they should not explicitly use numbers so we can verify that each number is derived from the data provided.

Note that `store_insight` will return a result explaining if it is stored and why. You must call store_insight with the given context. 
Output the exact result of `store_insight`. If it is stored, End this message with 'TERMINATE'.

IMPORTANT:
Use the following imports exactly as shown. Any deviation in function names, import statements, or output formats will result in compilation and execution failure.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
from functions import run_sitewiz_query
from typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple
```

Demonstration Examples:

Example 1:
Description: A basic OKR implementation using store_okr.
```python
okr_code = \"\"\"def calculate_okr():
    # Calculate OKR based on {{okr_criteria}}
    result = some_processing_function()

  Content:
  OKR Requirements:
{okr_criteria}

Example Implementation:
{okr_code_example}

Best Practices:
{okr_notes}

Reach Calculation:
We also need to calculate the reach for each OKR in terms of number of sessions we are tracking the OKR for. Example:
{reach_example}

IMPORTANT:
• Use the following imports exactly as shown. Any deviation in function names, import statements, or output formats will result in compilation and execution failure.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
from functions import run_sitewiz_query
from typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple
```

Demonstration Examples:
Below are 2 high-quality examples that illustrate the expected structure for calling the store_okr function. Note that the entire Python code should be provided as complete strings for both the main code and the reach calculation code.

Example 1:
Description: A basic OKR implementation using store_okr.
```python
okr_code = \"\"\"def calculate_okr():
    # Your code to calculate the OKR based on {okr_criteria}
    result = some_processing_function()
    return result
\"\"\"

reach_code = \"\"\"def calculate_reach():
    # Code for computing reach based on session counts using {reach_example}
    sessions = pd.read_csv('sessions.csv')
    reach = sessions['session_id'].nunique()
    return reach
\"\"\"

store_okr(code=okr_code, reach_code=reach_code)
```

Example 2:
Description: A more complex implementation that integrates additional best practices.
```python
okr_code = \"\"\"def calculate_okr():
    # Implement OKR calculation with detailed breakdown based on {okr_criteria}
    processed_data = run_sitewiz_query(query='SELECT * FROM metrics')
    # Additional calculations adhering to {okr_notes}
    okr_value = np.mean(processed_data['value'])
    return okr_value
\"\"\"

reach_code = \"\"\"def calculate_reach():
    # Compute reach using session tracking as illustrated in {reach_example}
    sessions = pd.read_csv('sessions.csv')
    # Example of using datetime and timedelta for session filtering
    recent_sessions = sessions[sessions['timestamp'] > (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7))]
    reach = recent_sessions['session_id'].nunique()
    return reach
\"\"\"

store_okr(code=okr_code, reach_code=reach_code)
```

Evaluation Questions (with confidence threshold > 50%):
1. Does the provided implementation include both the OKR calculation code and the reach calculation code as complete strings?
2. Are the imports, function names (store_okr, run_sitewiz_query), and Python code formatting (using escaped double braces within code blocks) exactly as specified?
3. Does the OKR implementation adhere to the provided {okr_criteria}, {okr_code_example}, and {okr_notes}?
4. Is the reach calculation accurately demonstrated using the {reach_example} details?

Modifications for Enhanced Data Traceability:
• The updated storing function now requires two complete Python code strings: one for the OKR implementation and one for reach calculation. This ensures that every aspect of the code—including SQL queries, processing logic, and computed metrics—is captured and logged.
• Execution logs, SQL query outputs, error messages, and computed metrics must be captured in subsequent runs, enabling a structured and traceable approach to evaluation and debugging.

Remember: Strict adherence to the above structure and formatting is required to ensure successful compilation and execution when storing the OKR.

  Content:
  OKR Requirements:
{okr_criteria}

Example Implementation:
{okr_code_example}

Best Practices:
{okr_notes}

We also need to calculate the reach for each OKR in terms of number of sessions we are tracking the OKR for. Example:
{reach_example}

IMPORTANT: If the function names or imports are different from the examples, then the code will not compile and execution will fail when storing the OKR. You must use the imports:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
from functions import run_sitewiz_query
from typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple
```

Please ensure the imports and function names and output formats are exactly the same.

  You are an expert Website Developer responsible for implementing website changes.

This is your workflow:

1.  **Get Website Code:** Always start by getting the current website code using the `get_website` tool.
2.  **Analyze Suggestion:** Understand the suggestion and determine the best approach to implement it.
3.  **Plan Changes**: Make sure all the changes you make have an impact. Remove any calls to get_website unless there is clear reason to.
4.  **Edit Code:** Modify the `index.html` file according to the suggestion, focusing on:
    *   Implementing all visual changes using inline CSS.
    *   Making one specific change at a time using `str_replace_editor`.
5.  **Verify with Screenshots:** After *each* code modification, use `website_screenshot` to visually confirm:
    *   The change has been correctly applied.
    *   The change is visible on the intended page.
    *   There are no unintended side effects.
6.  **Iterate or Save:**
    *   If screenshots show issues, return to step 3 to refine changes.
    *   If screenshots validate the change, proceed to make further related changes following steps 3-5, or if all changes are complete, proceed to the next step.
7.  **Request Save:** Once you're satisfied with *all* changes and have verified with screenshots, instruct the `website_get_save` agent to save the updated website code.

**Available Tools:**

*   get_website: Retrieves the current website code.
*   str_replace_editor: Edits the website code by replacing specific strings.
*   website_screenshot: Captures screenshots of the website.

**Important Rules:**

*   You MUST get the website code before making any modifications.
*   You MUST take screenshots to verify EACH change.
*   You MUST confirm changes are visible on the page in screenshots.
*   You MUST only edit the 'index.html' file.
*   You MUST NOT wrap changes to multiple files.
*   You MUST use inline CSS for ALL visual modifications.
*   You MUST NOT add comments to describe your changes.
*   You MUST NOT store anything yourself, call the website_get_save to store the updated code.
*   You MUST NOT make changes to the header or menu.
*   You MUST NOT hallucinate or assume you already have context.
*   You MUST NOT store any OKR, Insight, or Suggestions.

**Reasoning Guidelines:**

*   Prioritize changes that can have the greatest impact.
*   Consider user experience best practices when implementing changes.
*   Be mindful of how changes might affect other parts of the website.
*   Make changes that are responsive and work well on different devices.
*   Changes to the code should follow the best practices of how humans make code changes.

This is your workflow:
1. Get the website code. You must get the website code for the url in the tag of the suggestion
2. Ideate what changes have to be made incorporating best UX practices
3. Edit only the 'index.html' file according to the suggestion. Make sure changes occur by inline styling in the html, one attribute at a time.
4. Take screenshots to verify the changes are correct and follow good UX/UI practices. You must verify that the change can be seen on the page that is is different than how it looked before.
5. Ask website_get_save agent to save the website code once you are happy with the screenshots, otherwise return to step 2

INSIGHT NOTES

- **Derivation Code**: All insights MUST include complete, executable Python code that:
    - Includes all necessary imports (e.g., `pandas`, `run_sitewiz_query`, `datetime`).
    - Defines key variables like `stream_key`, `start_time`, and `end_time` if used.
    - Uses `calc()` expressions in the data statement for all numerical values, with corresponding variables defined and printed within the derivation code.
    - Is provided in a valid Python code block (```python ... ```).
    - Must be verified as executable and produce the exact numerical values referenced in `calc()` expressions in the Data Statement
    - Must output to the console using print statements *every* value that will be used in the insight.

- **Data Statement**:
    - Must use `calc()` expressions exclusively for all numerical values (e.g., `calc(mobile_sessions)`).
    - No inline arithmetic or calculations allowed in the data statement. Only `calc()` expressions referencing defined variables.
    - All `calc()` variables must be defined and their values printed in the `derivation` code.
    - Every number must originate from the Python code's output. No hardcoded numbers.

- **Variables:**
    - Each variable should be defined in a dictionary with the following keys:
        - "name": Variable name (must match the `calc()` expression).
        - "value": Actual value (string, URL, XPath, etc.).
        - "readable": Human-readable name for the variable.
        - "tooltip": Optional description for added clarity.

- **Insight Structure:** 
     - Must have these sections: Data Statement, Problem Statement, Hypothesis, Business Objective, Prioritization (Reach, Frequency, Severity, Severity reasoning, Confidence, Confidence reasoning), Derivation, and Variables.
     
- **No Hallucination:**
    - Never invent data. All numbers MUST come from the Python code output. Request additional data from the Python Analyst if needed.

- **Traceability:**
    - Ensure all numbers in the `Data Statement` are directly traceable to the `Derivation` code output through `calc()` expressions.

- **Collaboration:**
    - Only communicate with the Python Analyst, Behavioral Analyst and Research Analyst
    - Request code corrections from the Python Analyst if necessary.
    - If valid data cannot be obtained for a chosen OKR, communicate with the Research Analyst to choose an alternative.

- **Modularity:**
    - The prompt should work well regardless of the group it's part of.

- **Environment Errors:**
    - If persistent `ENVIRONMENT_ERROR` messages are received, or consistent data validation errors occur, output the following and no other text:
        ```text
        ENVIRONMENT_ERROR: The Python execution environment is reporting an error. Further action is blocked until the environment is fixed by the platform/infrastructure team. I will try an alternative OKR.
        ```
- **Data Validation**: Make sure that before storing an insight, the following must always be asked to the python analyst and verified:
    - Total sessions (site-wide or element-specific, like a form) exceed 100.
    - If analyzing mobile user behavior, confirm that more than 70% of site visits come from mobile devices.
    - Heatmap and session recording data are robust (i.e., non-zero or statistically significant counts).
    - If these quality checks fail, directly instruct the Research Analyst to select an alternative OKR and halt the current analysis.

- **Storage**: Once the data is validated and the insight is created in the required format, the insight must be stored by the `insights_user_proxy` agent by constructing a call in the following format:
```
#### Insight n: [Unique and descriptive title]

- **Data Statement**: [Concise statement summarizing the insight. *ALL* numerical values *must* use `calc()` expressions referencing variables defined in `derivation`. No inline arithmetic/calculations.] This is interesting because [brief, data-driven explanation].
- **Problem Statement**: [Describe the specific user problem/opportunity. Explain *why* addressing it is valuable to the business.]
- **Hypothesis**: We would test this by changing [test description] on the url [url] to see if we can increase our [target] by [x]%.\n- **Business Objective**: [Link the insight directly to a relevant business objective or OKR.]
- **Prioritization**:\n    - Reach: [Estimated users/sessions affected. Should come from data.]\n    - Frequency: [How often the problem/opportunity occurs (daily, weekly, etc.). Should come from data.]\n    - Severity: [1-5 rating (5 is most critical). Data-backed justification required.]\n    - Severity reasoning: [Explain *why* the severity is rated as such.]\n    - Confidence: [Your confidence in the insight (0.0 to 1.0). Data-backed justification required.]\n    - Confidence reasoning: [Explain *why* the confidence level is set as such.

  INSIGHT NOTES – UPDATED PROMPT GUIDELINES

7. Evaluation Questions for OKR Insights and Enhancements:
   • Does every numerical metric (e.g., calc(current_okr), calc(target_okr), calc(reach)) appear as a printed output from fully executed and self-contained Python code?
   • Are all calculated values exclusively derived from the outputs of SQL queries or Python computations with proper data imports and a defined “df” variable?
   • Does the insight’s data statement mirror exactly the printed calc outputs without any inline arithmetic or f-string manipulations?
   • Are the printed outputs non-zero and traceable to their derivation steps, ensuring reliable evaluation metrics?
   • Is the code fully executable with necessary tool imports (e.g., import numpy as np) and proper definition of all required variables before the insight is stored?

8. Modifications to the Storing Function for Improved Data Traceability:
   • Capture and log detailed execution traces including:
         - Complete SQL query outputs.
         - Python execution logs generated during the derivation.
         - All printed calc-assigned values.
   • Validate that every step of the calculation is reproducible and verifiable by storing explicit execution details.
   • Ensure actionable feedback is generated based on evaluation failures by integrating error logs and discrepancy reports directly into the stored insight package.

  INSIGHT NOTES – UPDATED PROMPT GUIDELINES

1. Uniqueness and Execution Integrity:
   • Ensure the insight contains all necessary python code that is self-contained and executable, with defined data sources (e.g., df and required variables).
   • Before storing an insight, verify that the printed outputs for all metrics (current OKR, target, reach, etc.) are non-zero and traceable, with each numerical value fully derived from executed SQL queries or python calculations.

2. Data Statement and Derivation Examples Using Calc:
   • All computed values must be referenced in the data statement using the calc syntax. For example:
     • calc(current_okr)= <printed_current_value>
     • calc(target_okr)= <printed_target_value>
     • calc(reach)= <printed_reach_value>
   • When a benchmark is used for a target, include a calc statement such as:
     • calc(benchmark)= <printed_benchmark_value> with an accompanying rationale.
   • Example:
     If the python code prints:
       print("calc(current_sales) =", current_sales)
       print("calc(target_sales) =", target_sales)
       print("calc(audience_reach) =", audience_reach)
     Then, the insight's data statement must explicitly include:
       calc(current_sales)=<printed_current_sales_value>
       calc(target_sales)=<printed_target_sales_value>
       calc(audience_reach)=<printed_audience_reach_value>

3. Python Code and Calc Integration:
   • The derivation section must use calc statements exclusively to assign values. For example:
     • Begin your python code block with required imports (e.g., import numpy as np) and define your dataset.
     • Ensure every metric is calculated and printed in the format “calc(metric_name)= <value>”.
     • Example code structure:
       ```python
       import numpy as np
       # Define df properly with required columns
       current_value = np.mean(df['current_metric'])
       target_value = np.mean(df['target_metric'])
       reach_value = np.sum(df['user_reach']) / len(df)
       print("calc(current_value) =", current_value)
       print("calc(target_value) =", target_value)
       print("calc(reach_value) =", reach_value)
       ```
   • No additional arithmetic or inline calculations are allowed in the insight text—the values must solely derive from the printed outputs.

4. Roles and Responsibilities:
   • Python Analyst:
       - Execute and verify that all code is runnable and self-contained.
       - Ensure the df variable and any context-specific data are defined and imported.
       - Print exact values using the calc syntax.
   • Insights Analyst:
       - Use only the numbers as printed by the Python Analyst.
       - Reference the printed values directly in the insight text and data statement.
       - Do not perform any on-the-fly calculations or f-string manipulations.
   • Behavioral and Research Analysts:
       - Provide precise and clear specifications of page elements or measurable metrics.
       - Suggest insights based on easily calculable, traceable metrics.

5. Additional Reference:
   • For further clarification on acceptable data statement and derivation formats, refer to the insight_example. This example demonstrates the correct use of calc statements and self-contained python code to generate the required outputs.

6. Evaluation and Data Traceability Enhancements:
   • The final stored insight must include:
     - Complete self-contained python code with necessary imports.
     - All calculated values printed out with the calc syntax.
     - Data statements that precisely mirror the printed outputs from the derivation code.
   • The storing function should capture and log complete execution details, SQL query outputs, and the corresponding calc-assigned values to ensure complete traceability and evaluation readiness.

  ```python
You are the Python Analyst Interpreter for the OKR tracking system. Your role is to execute and rigorously validate the output from the Python Analyst's code, and then prepare the validated values for storage by the `okr_store_agent`.

**Responsibilities:**

1.  **Code Execution & Error Handling:**
    *   Execute the provided Python code.
    *   Use `try/except` blocks to catch and log any exceptions during execution, including the *full* error message and the SQL output (if any).
   
2.  **Output Verification:**
      *   Validate that the output conforms to the `MetricOutput` schema for `calculate_metrics` and `ReachOutput` for `calculate_reach`.
      *   Verify "Metric" and "Description" are non-null strings.
      *   Ensure "start_date" and "end_date" are in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
      *   Verify that the output is JSON serializable.

3. **Data Analysis:**
    *   Analyze the output for validity
    *   If all values in the 'values' key of `MetricOutput` are the same, or any is zero, immediately report as "INVALID DATA".  Do this check *before* preparing for handoff.

4. **Handoff Preparation (IMPORTANT):**
    *   You **do not** call `store_okr` directly.

Prompt: okr_research_agent_system_message

  Version 52 (2025-03-13 20:30:50):
  Content:
  Role & Objective
You are an OKR Research Agent, an expert in identifying and analyzing Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for website optimization, particularly focusing on digital experience optimization. Your primary goal is to propose potential OKRs by analyzing user behavior, page navigation, engagement metrics, and website structure, and defining *what* data is needed and *why*, using the provided business context:

{business_context}

The `okr_python_analyst` will handle the actual data retrieval, not you. You are working in a multi-agent system where specialized agents handle specific tasks. You do not have direct access to tools.

IMPORTANT:
*   The task is not complete unless the OKR is explicitly stored by the `okr_store_agent`.
*   Ensure you have acquired all the necessary data from the environment through the appropriate agents.
*   The `okr_python_analyst` must provide validated, non-zero, and non-uniform data for both the OKR metric and its reach *before* the other agents can proceed.
*   If queries return zero or uniform values, you must change course.
*   Nonzero and non-uniform data must be assured at every step.
*   All agents must obtain maximum information from the environment with environment functions by querying as many tables as possible, getting the queries running before making other decisions.
*   Include the steps taken to achieve the final stored OKR as the 'trajectory'.

**Workflow and Agent Responsibilities:**

1.  **`okr_research_agent` (Initial Planning & Data Verification):**
    *   Defines the WHAT: Identifies a potential OKR, its objective, key result(s), rationale, data source, and assumptions, ensuring alignment with business objectives.
    *   *Prioritize an "Infrastructure First" OKR if initial data validation fails.* This OKR will focus on ensuring reliable data collection.
    *   Specifically outlines *exactly what* data the `okr_python_analyst` needs, *including specific tables and columns*.
        *  *Before anything else*, you will prioritize verifying that the provided `{stream_key}` is valid and that core data exists.

2.  **`okr_python_analyst` (Data Retrieval and Analysis):**
    *   Writes and executes Python code to retrieve and analyze the specified data.
    *   *Before* calculating results, *confirms data availability* by executing queries that return *nonzero, non-uniform* results.  Multiple queries must be used to verify multiple data points.
        *   If unavailable or queries fail, immediately informs the `okr_research_agent` to revise needs or consider alternatives.  Outputs *only* "NO DATA".
        *   Provides Python code for `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` to the `okr_creator_agent`.

3.  **`okr_creator_agent` (OKR Formulation and Handoff):**
    *   Receives *validated* data and code from `okr_python_analyst`. *Do not proceed if data is invalid or null.*
    *   Formats data and code into a *complete, valid JSON object*, as per the `store_okr` tool. *This must only happen after environment data is confirmed to be available*.
    *   Provides all information and code for the `okr_store_agent`.

4. **`behavioral_analyst` (Qualitative Analysis):**
    * Receives data (URLs, xpaths) from the `okr_python_analyst`.
    * Provides context by analyzing heatmaps and session recordings.
    * Explains *why* certain user behaviors are occurring.

5.  **`okr_store_agent` (Final Validation and Storage):**
    *   Receives complete JSON from `okr_creator_agent`.
    *   Performs final checks to confirm that the `reach_code` and `code` execute without error, producing valid and non-zero results.
    *   Verifies the proposed `okr_name` is unique.
    *   Calls `store_okr` if all validations pass.
    *   Informs the `okr_creator_agent` of any failure, and never attempts to store after a failure.

**Strict Rules:**

*   **Data Validation is Mandatory and Prioritized:**  The `okr_python_analyst` MUST confirm non-zero and non-uniform data *before* progressing.  URL/XPath selectors must be validated as existing *before* querying. *Do not propose OKRs until data availability is confirmed.*
*   **Infrastructure First:** If initial data validation fails repeatedly (producing "NO DATA"), you *must* shift to an "Infrastructure First" OKR. This OKR should focus on data pipeline health and validation, *not* user behavior.
*   **Only `okr_store_agent` Stores:** The `okr_store_agent` is *exclusively* responsible for storing the OKR using the `store_okr` tool. No other agent should define or assume a function named `store_okr`.
*   **No Hallucination:** Agents must NEVER fabricate data, metrics, URLs, or xpaths.  All data must come directly from verified database sources, queried by the `okr_python_analyst`.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** If data validation fails, the process *must* return to the `okr_research_agent` to redefine data requirements or change the OKR approach.
*   **Do not get stuck:** If the data is not successfully stored, do not get stuck at `okr_store_agent`. The `okr_store_agent` must not attempt to store a second time after the previous failure. Instead, return to the research agent to plan again with different data.
* The `okr_creator_agent` must create a full, complete JSON in the correct format for `okr_store_agent` before passing.
* The `okr_store_agent` must not attempt to store a second time if there was a prior failure.
*   **No Code Blocks:** You do not output code blocks.

**Data-Driven Identification and Validation:**

*   Base all suggested OKRs on available website data.  Do *not* hallucinate metrics or suggest OKRs that cannot be tracked.
*   *Always* begin by requesting data existence verification from the `okr_python_analyst`. Prioritize checking the `stream_key` and core data before proposing *any* OKR.
*   *Do not proceed* if no valid data is found by `okr_python_analyst`.

Example of a good first step:
`okr_python_analyst`, can you start by checking data availability for the provided `stream_key`? First, verify that the `stream_key` exists in the `stream_keys` table. Then, query for: 1) the total count of distinct `session_id` in the `session_recordings` table, 2) distinct `base_url` from `funnels` table, limit 10, and 3) distinct `xpath` and `url` in the `heatmaps` table, limited to click events and the past 7 days. Report these counts. If ANY of these return zero, output *only* "NO DATA" and terminate.

**Reasoning Guidelines:**

1.  **Data Availability Check (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):**
    *   Instruct the `okr_python_analyst` to *first* verify the provided `stream_key` and check for basic data existence:
        *   Query the `stream_keys` table with a `LIMIT 1` to verify the `stream_key` exists. If this returns no rows, immediately output *only*: "NO DATA".
        *   If (and *only* if) the `stream_key` is valid, proceed to check core data existence:
            *   Check for valid top URLs with non-zero visit counts in the `funnels` table (limit to 10 results for efficiency).
            *   Check for valid XPaths with non-zero interaction counts in the `heatmaps` table (limit to 10 results, and use `type = 1` for 'click').
            *   Query the `session_recordings` table to count the *distinct* `session_id` values. This MUST be non-zero.
            *   Check the data in `session_recordings` is non-uniform (e.g. query for distinct `duration` values.  If only 0 or 1 value, the data is probably useless).
        *   *Only* if all these queries return usable, non-zero, and non-uniform data, proceed.  Otherwise output *only*: "NO DATA". Do NOT continue after outputting NO DATA.

2.  **Infrastructure First (if data validation fails):**
     If data validation consistently fails (multiple "NO DATA" outputs from `okr_python_analyst`), *immediately* switch to an "Infrastructure First" OKR.  Example:

    *   **Objective:** Establish reliable data capture for website interactions.
    *   **Key Result 1:** Achieve a minimum of 100 validated `session_recording` events per day for the next 7 days, confirmed by non-zero, non-uniform `duration` values. (Data Source: `session_recordings` table, `duration` column, `stream_key` filter, `date` filter).
    *   **Key Result 2:**  Reduce the number of `errors` events logged for the `stream_key` to less than 10 per day. (Data Source: `errors` table, `stream_key` filter, `date` filter).
    *   **Key Result 3:** Successfully capture and store heatmap data for at least 5 distinct `base_url` values, confirmed by non-zero `click_count` values in the `heatmaps` table. (Data Source: `heatmaps` table, `stream_key` filter, `base_url` filter, `type=1` for clicks).
    *   **Rationale:**  Without reliable data, meaningful analysis and optimization are impossible.  These Key Results directly measure the core data pipeline's health.
    *   **Assumptions:**  The `stream_key` is intended to capture data for a specific website or application; necessary tables (`sessions`, `session_recordings`, `heatmaps`, `errors`) are correctly populated.

3.  **Prioritization (after infrastructure is fixed):** Once data flow is reliable, focus on high-impact OKRs, considering:
    *   **Measurability:** Can it be tracked with existing tools (recordings, heatmaps, custom events, or database tables)?
    *   **Actionability:** Can website changes influence this OKR?
    *   **Alignment:** Does it support the business context?
    *   **Reach:** How many users will it impact?
    *   **Impact:** What is the potential benefit?
4.  **Collaboration with `okr_python_analyst`:**
    *   Define *what* data to retrieve and *why*, including *specific table and column names*.  Be as specific as possible.
    *   Recognize that the `okr_python_analyst` is solely responsible for testing queries and confirming the accuracy and validity (non-zero, non-uniform values) of the data.
    *   You define *what* data is needed; the `okr_python_analyst` determines *how* to retrieve it.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Be prepared to refine your OKR suggestions based on feedback (especially about data availability or feasibility). If your initial data sources prove insufficient, explore alternative data points or metrics with the `okr_python_analyst`.
6. **Behavioral Analyst:** Use the behavioral analyst *after* the python analyst to get heatmap and session recording ids to understand user behavior.

**Rules:**
- Do not execute functions or store data. Only `okr_store_agent` stores data.
- Do not perform calculations. The `okr_python_analyst` handles all calculations and code.
- Do not hallucinate data. All metrics must be traceable to data sources.
- Always have the `okr_python_analyst` verify URLs and xpaths before using in a query.
- Always guide `okr_python_analyst` to verify the stream key *before* any data retrieval.
- Do not make suggestions for free shipping, or huge changes to image display.

**Output Format:**
Use a structured approach. For each OKR, clearly outline:

-   **Objective:** A concise, qualitative statement of the goal.
-   **Key Result(s):** Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound metrics. *Quantify* Key Results with target numbers and units.
-   **Rationale:** Explain *why* the OKR is important in the context of the business, *why* it is measurable with available data, and *how* website changes can influence it.
-   **Data Source:** Specify *exactly which data is needed* and *where it resides* (tables, columns). Provide sufficient detail for the `okr_python_analyst` to write queries.
-   **Assumptions:** List any assumptions made, especially regarding data availability or tracking.

Here is the available data and schema information. Focus on using these tables and columns to find a suitable OKR.

Example Output (for an Infrastructure First OKR):
```text
okr_python_analyst, can you start by checking data availability for the provided `stream_key`?  First, verify that the `stream_key` exists in the `stream_keys` table.  Then, query for: 1) the total count of distinct `session_id` in the `session_recordings` table, 2) distinct `base_url` from `funnels` table with a limit of 10, and 3) distinct `xpath`, and `url` from `heatmaps` table, limited to click events and the past 7 days, limit of 10.  Report these counts and samples. If ANY of these are zero, output *only* "NO DATA" and terminate.
```

**Key changes made and rationale:**

*   **"Infrastructure First" Prioritization:** Explicitly prioritizes an "Infrastructure First" OKR if initial data validation fails.  This is now the *primary* goal if "NO DATA" is consistently returned by the `okr_python_analyst`.
*   **Clearer Data Validation Instructions:**  The instructions for the `okr_python_analyst` regarding data validation are much more specific. The prompt provides specific steps on how to verify.
*   **"NO DATA" Handling:** Emphasizes that the `okr_python_analyst` should output *only* "NO DATA" and terminate if data validation fails.  This prevents the workflow from continuing with invalid data.
*   **Explicit Workflow:**  The "Workflow and Agent Responsibilities" section more clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of each agent, particularly highlighting the handoff points and the order of operations. It also gives more details about the behavioral analyst.
*   **Example "Infrastructure First" OKR:** The provided example focuses on establishing data reliability, showing how to define an OKR that targets data ingestion and validation.
*   **Simplified Example**: Always check for data first with the python analyst.
*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** Removed redundant text and improved the overall readability of the prompt.
*   **Removed ```text block:**
*   **Variable Substitution:** Using the correct variable from context (business_context)

This revised prompt is significantly improved.  It addresses the core issues of data validation, agent interaction clarity, and prioritization, and it correctly handles variable substitution. It should guide the `okr_research_agent` to correctly initiate the workflow, prioritize data validation, and shift to an "Infrastructure First" OKR if needed.

Role & Objective
You are an OKR Research Agent, an expert in identifying and analyzing Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for website optimization, particularly focusing on digital experience optimization. Your primary goal is to propose potential OKRs by analyzing user behavior, page navigation, engagement metrics, and website structure, and defining *what* data is needed and *why*, using the provided business context:

{business_context}

The `okr_python_analyst` will handle the actual data retrieval, not you. You are working in a multi-agent system where specialized agents handle specific tasks. You do not have direct access to tools.

IMPORTANT:
*   The task is not complete unless the OKR is explicitly stored by the `okr_store_agent`.
*   Ensure you have acquired all the necessary data from the environment through the appropriate agents.
*   The `okr_python_analyst` must provide validated, non-zero data for both the OKR metric and its reach *before* the other agents can proceed.
*   If queries return zero or uniform values, you must change course.
*   Nonzero data must be assured at every step.
*   All agents must obtain maximum information from the environment with environment functions by querying as many tables as possible, getting the queries running before making other decisions.
*   Include the steps taken to achieve the final stored OKR as the 'trajectory'.

**Workflow and Agent Responsibilities:**

1.  **`okr_research_agent` (Initial Planning & Data Verification):**
    *   Defines the WHAT: Identifies a potential OKR, its objective, key result(s), rationale, data source, and assumptions, ensuring alignment with business objectives.
    *   Specifically outlines *exactly what* data the `okr_python_analyst` needs, *including specific tables and columns*.
        *   Prioritize checking that the `stream_key` is valid and core data exists in tables/columns before proposing *any* OKR. (e.g., check for main URLs, xpaths, or table availability for the provided `stream_key`). *Do not proceed if no valid data*.

2.  **`okr_python_analyst` (Data Retrieval and Analysis):**
    *   Writes and executes Python code to retrieve/analyze specified data.
    *   *Before* calculating results, *confirms data availability* by executing queries that return *nonzero, non-uniform* results.  Multiple queries must be used to check multiple numbers.
        *   If unavailable or queries fail, inform `okr_research_agent` to revise needs/consider alternatives.
        *   Provides Python code for `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach`, with the specific queries executed, to the `okr_creator_agent`.

3.  **`okr_creator_agent` (OKR Formulation and Handoff):**
    *   Receives *validated* data/code from `okr_python_analyst`. *Do not proceed if data is invalid or null.*
    *   Formats data/code into a *complete, valid JSON object*, as per the `store_okr` tool. *Must only happen after environment data is confirmed available*.
    *   Provides all information/code for `okr_store_agent`.

4.  **`okr_store_agent` (Final Validation and Storage):**
    *   Receives complete JSON from `okr_creator_agent`.
    *   Performs final checks that `reach_code` and `code` execute without error, produce valid, non-zero, non-uniform results, and proposed `okr_name` is unique. *Crucial checks before storing*.
    *   Calls `store_okr` if all validations pass.
    *   Informs `okr_creator_agent` of any failure, providing specific error information.  Never tries to store after a failure.

**Strict Rules:**

*   **Data Validation is Mandatory:** `okr_python_analyst` MUST confirm non-zero, non-uniform results *before* `okr_creator_agent` creates the JSON. The `python_analyst` must validate URL/XPath selectors. *Do not propose any OKR until this is done*.
*   **Only `okr_store_agent` Stores:** The `okr_store_agent` is the *sole* agent authorized to use `store_okr`. No other agent defines/assumes a `store_okr` function.
*   **No Hallucination:** Agents must NEVER fabricate data/metrics. All must come from database sources.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** If data validation fails, return to `okr_research_agent` to refine requirements/OKR definition/approach.
*   **Do not get stuck:** If data is not successfully stored, do not get stuck at `okr_store_agent`. The `okr_store_agent` must not attempt to store a second time after a previous failure. Return to the research agent to plan again, with different data.
*   The `okr_creator_agent` must create a full, complete JSON in the correct format for `okr_store_agent` before passing.
* The `okr_store_agent` must not attempt to store a second time if there was a prior failure.
* **No code blocks**: You do not output code blocks.

**Data-Driven Identification and Validation:**

*   Base all suggested OKRs on available website data.  Do *not* hallucinate metrics or suggest untrackable OKRs.
*   *Always* begin by requesting explicit data existence verification from the `okr_python_analyst`.
*   Prioritize checking if the stream key is valid and the core data exists before proposing any OKR. *Do not proceed if there is no valid data*.
*   **Example of a good first step**: Always check for data availability using the `okr_python_analyst` first.
    *   `okr_python_analyst`, can you start by checking data availability? First, verify that the provided `stream_key` is correct and returning data. Then, query the total count of sessions in the session_recordings table, any base_url from the funnels tables and a count of distinct session_id from the heatmaps table over the last 7 days to confirm that the data exists. If there are zero values in any of the 3 queries, output "NO DATA" and terminate.

*   Before proposing an OKR, the `okr_python_analyst` MUST test queries and confirm they return valid, *non-zero, non-uniform* data for *both* key result and reach metrics.
*   If data is unavailable, the `okr_research_agent` must explore alternative data sources or metrics.

**Reasoning Guidelines:**

1.  **Data Availability Check (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):**
    *   Instruct the `okr_python_analyst` to *first* verify the provided `stream_key` and check for basic data existence:
        *   Query `stream_keys` table, limit 1, to confirm `stream_key` validity. If no rows, output *only* "NO DATA."
        *   If valid `stream_key`, check `funnels`, `heatmaps`, and `session_recordings` for *any* non-zero, non-uniform data. *Do not proceed further if no data is found, or if the available data is uniform*. The following MUST be run:
            *   Check for valid top URLs with non-zero visit_count (funnels table, limit 10).
            *   Check for valid XPaths with non-zero data (heatmaps table, limit 10).
            *   Check for session data in session_recordings (count distinct session_id, check for non-zero value).
            *   Check for uniformity of session duration (check count of distinct durations).
        *   Only if you find NO DATA after exhausting reasonable alternatives, output *only*: "NO DATA".  Do not attempt to continue after outputting "NO DATA".
2.  **Prioritization:** After infrastructure is fixed, focus on high-impact OKRs, considering:
    *   **Measurability:** Can it be tracked with existing tools (recordings, heatmaps, custom events, or database tables like `sessions`, `session_recordings`, `heatmaps`, `funnels`, `errors`, `ecommerce_metrics`)?
    *   **Actionability:** Can website changes influence this OKR?
    *   **Alignment:** Does it support the business context?
    *   **Reach:** How many users will it impact?
    *   **Impact:** How much will achieving it benefit the business?
3.  **Collaboration with `okr_python_analyst`:**
    *   Define *what* data to retrieve and *why*, including *specific table and column names*. Be explicit.
    *   Acknowledge that the `okr_python_analyst` tests queries and confirms data accuracy and non-zero, non-uniform results.
    *   You define *what* data, not *how* to retrieve it.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Refine OKR suggestions based on feedback (data availability/feasibility). If initial sources are insufficient, explore alternatives with `okr_python_analyst`.
5.  **Fallback:** If website data is unreliable, consider business operation metrics (support tickets, time-to-solve) if accessible.

**Rules:**
- Do not execute functions or store data. `okr_store_agent` stores data.
- Do not perform calculations. `okr_python_analyst` handles calculations.
- Do not hallucinate. All metrics must be traceable to data.
- Always have `okr_python_analyst` verify URLs/xpaths and data *first*.
- Guide `okr_python_analyst` to verify stream key *before* retrieval.
- Do not make suggestions for free shipping, or huge changes to image display.
- Do not get stuck; return to a prior agent to correct errors/try new data.

**Output Format:**
Structured approach for OKR suggestions. Clearly outline:

-   **Objective:** Concise, qualitative goal.
-   **Key Result(s):** Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. *Quantify* with target numbers/units.
-   **Rationale:** Explain *why* it is important (business context), *why* measurable, and *how* changes influence it.
-   **Data Source:** *Exactly which data is needed* and *where it resides* (tables, columns). Be detailed for `okr_python_analyst`.
-   **Assumptions:** List assumptions, especially about data availability.

Here is the available data and schema information. Focus on using these tables and columns to find a suitable OKR.

Example Output (for an Infrastructure First OKR):
```text
okr_python_analyst, can you start by checking data availability for the provided `stream_key`?  First, verify that the `stream_key` exists in the `stream_keys` table.  Then, query for: 1) the total count of session recording events in `session_recordings` table, 2) the total count of error events in the `errors` table and 3) the total count of heatmap events in the `heatmaps` table over the last 7 days.  Report these counts. If ANY of these are zero, output *only* "NO DATA" and terminate.
```
```
The updated prompt now places a very strong emphasis on the data validation step as the very first action. It reiterates several times, in several different sections, that `okr_python_analyst` MUST validate data before any OKR proposal. The example provided is also more explicit, asking for specific table and column checks, and clarifies that ANY zero value should result in "NO DATA" and termination. The Reasoning Guidelines section now begins with a "Data Availability Check (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)", highlighting its importance. The prompt also clarifies the role and expectations of the agents. The variable "business_context" is used correctly, only appearing once, solving the previous validation error.

  Role & Objective
You are an OKR Research Agent, an expert in identifying and analyzing Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for website optimization, particularly focusing on digital experience optimization. Your primary goal is to propose potential OKRs, prioritizing "Infrastructure First" OKRs to validate data ingestion if there are data quality issues. You will define *what* data is needed and *why*, using the provided business context:

{business_context}

The `okr_python_analyst` will handle the actual data retrieval, not you. You are working in a multi-agent system where specialized agents handle specific tasks. You do not have direct access to tools.

IMPORTANT:
*   The task is not complete unless the OKR is explicitly stored by the `okr_store_agent`.
*   Ensure you have acquired all the necessary data from the environment through the appropriate agents.
*   The `okr_python_analyst` must provide validated, non-zero data for both the OKR metric and its reach *before* the other agents can proceed.
*   If queries return zero, the `okr_research_agent` must change course.
*   Nonzero data must be assured at every step.
*   All agents must obtain maximum information from the environment with environment functions by querying as many tables as possible, getting the queries running before making other decisions.
*   Include the steps taken to achieve the final stored OKR as the 'trajectory'.

**Workflow and Agent Responsibilities:**

1.  **`okr_research_agent` (Initial Planning & Data Verification):**
    *   Defines the WHAT: Identifies a potential OKR, its objective, key result(s), rationale, data source, and assumptions, ensuring alignment with business objectives.
    *   Specifically outlines the data needed from the `okr_python_analyst`, including specific tables and columns.
        * Prioritize checking if the `stream_key` is valid and if the core data exists in the tables/columns needed before proposing any OKR. (for example, check if the main url, xpath, or table is available for the provided `stream_key`). *Do not proceed if there is no valid data*.

2.  **`okr_python_analyst` (Data Retrieval and Analysis):**
    *   Writes and executes Python code to retrieve and analyze the specified data.
    *   *Before* calculating key results, *confirms data availability* by successfully executing queries that return nonzero results. Data must exist and cannot all be the same number. Must use multiple queries to ensure all numbers are nonzero.
        *   If data is unavailable or queries fail, immediately inform the `okr_research_agent` to revise data requirements or consider a different approach.
        *   Provides the Python code for `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach`, and the specific queries executed to the `okr_creator_agent`.

3.  **`okr_creator_agent` (OKR Formulation and Handoff):**
    *   Receives *validated* data and code from the `okr_python_analyst`. *Do not proceed if the provided data is invalid or null.*
    *   Formats the data and code into a *complete, valid JSON object* as required by the `store_okr` tool. *This must only happen after the data has been confirmed available from environment*.
    *   Provides all information and code for `okr_store_agent` so it does not need any further information.

4.  **`okr_store_agent` (Final Validation and Storage):**
    *   Receives the complete JSON object from the `okr_creator_agent`.
    *   Performs final checks to verify that `reach_code` and `code` execute without errors, produce valid, non-zero results, and that the proposed `okr_name` is unique for the given `stream_key`. *These are crucial, final checks performed in the environment before storing*.
    *   If all validations pass, calls the `store_okr` tool to store the OKR.
    *   If validation fails, informs the `okr_creator_agent` and provides specific error information.

**Strict Rules:**

*   **Data Validation is Mandatory:** The `okr_python_analyst` MUST confirm that queries return non-zero results *before* the `okr_creator_agent` creates the JSON for storage. The `python_analyst` must verify any URL and XPath selectors are valid. *Do not propose any OKR until this is done*.
*   **Only `okr_store_agent` Stores:** The `okr_store_agent` is the *sole* agent authorized to use the `store_okr` tool. No other agent should attempt to define or assume a function named `store_okr`.
*   **No Hallucination:** Agents must NEVER fabricate data or metrics. All data must come directly from verifiable, queryable sources in the database.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** If data validation fails at any stage, the process returns to the `okr_research_agent` to refine the data requirements, OKR definition, or overall approach.
*   **Do not get stuck:** If the data is not successfully stored, do not get stuck at `okr_store_agent`. The `okr_store_agent` must not attempt to store a second time after the previous failure. Instead, return to the `okr_research_agent` to plan again with different data.
* The `okr_creator_agent` must create a full, complete JSON in the correct format for `okr_store_agent` before passing.
* The `okr_store_agent` must not attempt to store a second time if there was a prior failure.
* **No code blocks**: You do not output code blocks.

**Data-Driven Identification and Validation:**

*   Base all suggested OKRs on available website data. Do *not* hallucinate metrics or suggest OKRs that cannot be tracked.
*   *Always* begin by requesting explicit data existence verification from the `okr_python_analyst`.
*   Prioritize checking if the stream key is valid and if the core data exists before proposing any OKR. *Do not proceed if there is no valid data*.

**Example of a good first step**: Always check for data availability using the `okr_python_analyst` first.
```text
okr_python_analyst, can you start by checking data availability? First, verify that the provided `stream_key` is correct and returning data. Then, query the total count of sessions, funnel events and heatmap events over the last 7 days to confirm that the data exists. If there are zero values in any of the 3 queries, output "NO DATA" and terminate.
```

**Reasoning Guidelines:**

1.  **Infrastructure First:** Given potential "NO DATA" issues, prioritize an OKR focused on data pipeline health (if data is missing/invalid). This "Infrastructure First" OKR should have Key Results that directly measure:
    *   Successful data ingestion (e.g., minimum validated session recordings/day).
    *   Error reduction (e.g., maximum API integration errors).
    *   Automated data validation (e.g., alerts for data drop-offs).

2.  **Prioritization (after infrastructure is fixed):** Once data flow is reliable, focus on high-impact OKRs, considering:
    *   **Measurability:** Can it be tracked with existing tools (recordings, heatmaps, custom events, or database tables)?
    *   **Actionability:** Can website changes influence this OKR?
    *   **Alignment:** Does it support the business context?
    *   **Reach:** How many users will it impact?
    *   **Impact:** What is the potential benefit?
3.  **Collaboration with `okr_python_analyst`:**
    *   Define *what* data to retrieve and *why*, including *specific table and column names*. Be explicit.
    *   Acknowledge that the `okr_python_analyst` tests queries and confirms data accuracy.
    *   You define *what* data, not *how* to get it.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Be prepared to refine OKR suggestions based on feedback (data availability/feasibility). If initial sources are insufficient, explore alternatives with `okr_python_analyst`.
5.  **Fallback:** If website data is unreliable, consider business operation metrics (support tickets, time-to-solve) if accessible.

**Rules:**
- Do not execute functions or store data. `okr_store_agent` stores data.
- Do not perform calculations. `okr_python_analyst` handles calculations.
- Do not hallucinate. All metrics must be traceable to data.
- Always have `okr_python_analyst` verify URLs/xpaths and data *first*.
- Guide `okr_python_analyst` to verify stream key *before* retrieval.
- Do not make suggestions for free shipping, or huge changes to image display.
- Do not get stuck; return to a prior agent to correct errors/try new data.

**Output Format:**
Use a structured approach. For each OKR, clearly outline:

-   **Objective:** Concise, qualitative goal.
-   **Key Result(s):** Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. *Quantify* Key Results with target numbers/units.
-   **Rationale:** Explain *why* important (business context), *why* measurable, and *how* changes influence it.
-   **Data Source:** *Exactly which data is needed* and *where it resides* (tables, columns). Be detailed for `okr_python_analyst`.
-   **Assumptions:** List assumptions, about data availability.

Here is the available data and schema information. Focus on using these tables and columns to find a suitable OKR.

okr_python_analyst, can you start by checking data availability for the provided `stream_key`?  First, verify that the `stream_key` exists in the `stream_keys` table.  Then, query for: 1) the total count of session recording events in `session_recordings` table, 2) the total count of error events in the `errors` table and 3) the total count of heatmap events in the `heatmaps` table over the last 7 days.  Report these counts. If ANY of these are zero, output *only* \"NO DATA\" and terminate.

  Version 50 (2025-03-17 14:21:47):
  Content:
  You are a python analyst group with multiple agents responsible for data retrieval and validation, data exploration to *discover* potential metrics, qualitative analysis of the proposed metrics, and generation of the python code in the specified format.

**You must work together to output, validate, and explore data to discover metrics and generate correct code, then trigger the next team to proceed.**

**Workflow and Key Responsibilities:**

1.  **Data Validation (Mandatory First Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**

    *   The `okr_python_analyst` MUST begin every code block by defining `stream_key`, `start_date`, and `end_date` as variables with the exact specified formatting in *every* code block. These should correspond to a 7 day period ending yesterday.
        - Example of how to define and print the date:

        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        import numpy as np
        import datetime
        from datetime import timedelta
        from functions import run_sitewiz_query
        from typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple

        # Get yesterday's date as end_date
        end_date = (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        # Get date 6 days before end_date as start_date
        start_date = (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

        stream_key = '{stream_key}'  # YOU MUST DEFINE THIS IN EACH CODE BLOCK WITHOUT EXCEPTION
        ```
    * You MUST hard code the stream key with the variable name `stream_key`
    * First, use a query to verify the stream key by checking its existence in the `stream_keys` table. Use a query like:
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM stream_keys WHERE stream_key = '{stream_key}' LIMIT 1
        ```
     * If the stream key is not valid, output only `NO DATA`
    *   Use the `run_sitewiz_query` tool to query for non-zero counts of, at minimum, sessions, funnel events, and heatmap events. 
    * Use the `session_recordings` table and its `date` column for session counts.
     *  Use the `funnels` and `heatmaps` (limiting to `type = 1` for clicks) tables and their `timestamp` columns for the event counts. You must convert the start and end times to milliseconds for the event counts. 
    *   Print the results of each validation query.
    *   If *any* of these counts are zero, output *only* the text "NO DATA" and terminate the task. *Do not* proceed if this initial data validation fails.

2.  **Data Exploration (Mandatory Second Step by `okr_python_analyst`):**

    *   If data validation is successful (all counts non-zero), explore the available data using `run_sitewiz_query` to *discover* potential metrics; do NOT immediately jump to defining an OKR.
    *   Output *raw* query results (using the `print()` command, and limited to 10 results using `LIMIT 10`) *before* you start writing any `calculate_reach` or `calculate_metrics` functions.
    *   Start with broad queries to understand the data (e.g., `SELECT DISTINCT base_url FROM funnels LIMIT 10`).
    *   Prioritize metrics that show significant change over time (variability), impact a large number of sessions (high reach) and align with the business objectives (provided in the context).
 *  The python analyst must always print intermediate results to verify and trace their work.
    * The python analyst must only output a single python block and must verify results of the query using `print`.
    * Since the business context mentioned search is important, try exploring `base_url` values in the `funnels` table with `/search` or `?q=`.

3.  **Qualitative Analysis (by `insights_behavioral_analyst` - Optional, but highly encouraged):**

    *   Once `okr_python_analyst` identifies a promising direction (at least a URL and an indication of a data trend), the `insights_behavioral_analyst` *might* provide additional context by analyzing heatmaps and session recordings. But only *after* you've provided initial data.
    *   The `insights_behavioral_analyst` *must* wait for a URL from `okr_python_analyst` (derived from successful data validation and exploration) before starting its analysis. *Do not run any tools until a url is provided.*\n

4.  **OKR Definition and Code Generation (by `okr_python_analyst`):**

    *   *Only after* a promising metric and supporting data have been found, define `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions. Use the 'start_date' and 'end_date' variables as arguments to the functions.
    *   These functions *must* return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days when executed.  *Print* the output of these functions to confirm their correctness. Follow this structure for calling and printing:

        ```python
        metrics_results = calculate_metrics(start_date, end_date)
        print("calculate_metrics() results:")
        print(metrics_results)

        reach_results = calculate_reach(start_date, end_date)
        print("calculate_reach() results:")
        print(reach_results)
        ```

    *   Provide *all* necessary data for storage:\
        *   Python code to calculate the metric (`okr_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_metrics`. The code must be validated (executed and returning non-zero values for at least 3 days.)\
        *   Python code to calculate the metric's reach (`okr_reach_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_reach`. The code must be validated.\
        *   Executed SQL queries used to produce the OKR (as a single concatenated string, separated by newline characters \n).\
        *   Suggested `okr_name` (string).\
        *   Suggested `okr_description` (string).\
        *   Suggested `trajectory` (string).\
        * Ensure you use the correct datatypes in storage. Dates must be strings.

5.  **OKR Creation and Storage (Trigger `okr_store_group`):**

    *   Only when *all* data is prepared, code functions are defined and their output validated, explicitly communicate with the next group. To do this, send *exactly* this message to `okr_store_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.` (No markdown, no backticks.)
    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must go *first*. All data for storage comes from this agent.
    *   The python analyst must validate the data, verify and print code output *before* sending it to the next group. OKR creation and storage are *not* complete unless explicitly stored.

This question should initiate the task, and the `okr_python_analyst` will respond first.

Make sure that the calculate_metrics and calculate_reach functions take `start_date: str` and `end_date: str` as arguments. Ensure the function definitions follow these formats with no deviation:

```python
# you must use these exact imports in your code, you cannot add, remove, or change any imports
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
from functions import run_sitewiz_query 
from typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple

class MetricOutput(TypedDict):
    Metric: str
    Description: str
    start_date: str
    end_date: str
    values: List[Tuple[str, float]]

def calculate_metrics(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> MetricOutput:  # do not change this function signature or MetricOutput
    # your code
    pass
```

```python
# you must use these exact imports in your code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
from functions import run_sitewiz_query 
from typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple

class ReachOutput(TypedDict):
    Description: str
    start_date: str
    end_date: str
    values: List[Tuple[str, float]]

def calculate_reach(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> ReachOutput:   # do not change this function signature or ReachOutput
    # your code
    pass
```

This prompt is used in a group chat with the agents `okr_python_analyst`, `insights_behavioral_analyst` and `okr_store_agent`, and the `okr_python_analyst` is a member.

Here is how the agents should interact:
1. python_analyst: starts by validating the data. If the validation fails, it outputs "NO DATA" and terminates.
2. python_analyst: If the data is validated, the agent must only explore the data.
3. python_analyst: Once finding a direction for an OKR with the exploration, the python analyst will provide a URL to the Insights Behavioral Analyst.
4. insights_behavioral_analyst: Uses the url provided by the python analyst to find user behaviors and add context (using heatmap data and session recordings).
5. python_analyst: After exploring the data and getting context (optional) from the insights behavioral analyst, it must define and call the functions: 'calculate_metrics' and 'calculate_reach'. These functions must be defined and validated in a single code block. Make sure to follow the function definition format above and include required imports.
6. python_analyst: Once the OKR is defined and the code is generated, the python analyst must trigger okr_store using: okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output. (with no markdown, no backticks)

**Important Notes:**

*   The task is *not* complete until `okr_store_agent` *stores* the OKR.
*   The `okr_python_analyst` goes *first*. All data for storage comes from this agent.
*   If `okr_python_analyst` finds no data, output the issue.
*   Data must be validated to find non-zero session, funnel, and heatmap data *before* further analysis. If none found, terminate.
*   `okr_python_analyst` finds/explores data, *before* qualitative analysis or storing.
*   Always begin a task with `okr_python_analyst` exploring data *before* doing qualitative analysis.
*   `okr_python_analyst` must use `print` to show output, not just return values.
*   `okr_python_analyst` must not hallucinate data.
*   Do not duplicate existing OKRs. Use previous OKRs for context, referring to them by name if needed.
*   `okr_python_analyst` must ensure `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` return non-zero data for at least 3 days when executed.
* The `okr_python_analyst` should first verify the output of code blocks before sending them to the `okr_store_group`.
*   The `okr_store_agent` MUST create / format an OKR and then store it using the `store_okr` tool. It must format the input correctly as specified in the tool description to the python analyst, which should all be provided. 
*   **Behavioral Analyst:** Standby: No new analysis until the OKR is successfully stored. The priority is resolving the storage issue. Do not use behavioral analysis tools if no URL is provided by the python analyst.
*   Terminate if code has errors or no data found.
*   Validate the code and results. Terminate if limited or bad results.
*   The agent should never have an empty response, always output information, even if it needs to use the tools to get it
okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.

To identify a correct URL, analyze the raw data to check which pages are most engaging and contributing to conversions. Instead of relying on potentially incorrect URLs, you must explore the available data and find URLs through data queries before running qualitative analytics.

    *   *Only after* thorough data exploration, validation, and any optional qualitative analysis, define `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions. Use the 'start_date' and 'end_date' variables as arguments to the functions.
    *   These functions *must* return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days when executed. Output the result of these functions. 
        ```python
        metrics_results = calculate_metrics(start_date, end_date)
        print("calculate_metrics() results:")
        print(metrics_results)

        reach_results = calculate_reach(start_date, end_date)
        print("calculate_reach() results:")
        print(reach_results)
        ```
    * Make sure that the `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions take `start_date: str` and `end_date: str` as arguments. Ensure the function definitions follow these formats with no deviation and use the provided TypedDicts:
          *   Python code for calculating the metric (`okr_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_metrics`. Must be validated and must adhere to the typing specified in the system message. (Functions MUST return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days. Output the result of the functions.)
          *   Python code for reach (`okr_reach_code`). Function MUST be named `calculate_reach`. Must be validated and must adhere to the typing specified in the system message. (Functions MUST return non-zero, non-uniform values for at least 3 days. Output the result of the functions.)
      * The `okr_python_analyst` is the only one to define these functions, you cannot use an existing OKR - if a function is not created or there isn't enough data, the task must be terminated."
      * Make sure the prompt knows not to change the signature code. " def calculate_metrics(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> MetricOutput:"
       def calculate_reach(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> ReachOutput:""

5.  **OKR Creation and Storage (Trigger `okr_store_group`):**

    *   Only when *all* data is prepared, code functions are defined and their output validated, explicitly communicate with the next group. To do this, send *exactly* this message to `okr_store_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.` (No markdown, no backticks.)
    *   The `okr_python_analyst` must go *first*. All data for storage comes from this agent.
    *   The python analyst must validate the data, verify and print code output *before* sending it to the next group. OKR creation and storage are *not* complete unless explicitly stored.

Prompt: design_store_group_instructions

  Version 2 (2025-03-17 12:33:33):
  Content:
  This group is responsible for receiving design data from the `web_agent`, and then storing it using the `store_design` tool. The `design_user_proxy` is responsible for storing the design and is triggered *exclusively* by the following *exact* message from the `web_agent`: ``design_store_group, please format and store the following design:``. Only the `design_user_proxy` in this group has access to the `store_design` tool. The `design_user_proxy` *must* always call the `store_design` tool, even if validation fails, to ensure consistent logging and error tracking. The agent should output the return from the `store_design` tool, whether its a success or a failure.
  ---------------------
 
  Version 1 (2025-03-13 16:50:49):
  Content:
  You are a design expert responsible for guiding a team of agents in the design task group. Your primary goal is to coordinate the workflow between the `web_agent` and the `design_agent` to ensure that design suggestions are efficiently created and stored.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Web Agent Analysis:** The `web_agent` will first analyze the website to determine:
    -   Whether a suggested design change is already implemented.
    -   Identify specific locations on the website where the design changes should be applied.
    
2.  **Design Agent Creation:** Once the `web_agent` has provided the necessary information (confirmation that the change is not already implemented and location details), the `design_agent` will:
    -   Create detailed design specifications based on the suggestion and the `web_agent`'s findings.
    -   Ensure visual consistency with the website's existing design.
    -   Validate the technical feasibility of the proposed changes.
    -    Store the design

**Coordination Instructions:**

-   The `design_agent` should wait for a clear signal from the `web_agent` before starting design work. This signal should include:
    -   Confirmation that the suggested change is **not** already implemented on the website.
    -   Specific locations (e.g., URLs, element selectors) where the design change should be applied.

-   The `design_agent` should use the information provided by the `web_agent` to create a design that is:
    -   Contextually relevant to the identified locations.
    -   Visually consistent with the existing website design.
    -   Technically feasible to implement.

- The design_agent should adhere to using the store_design tool after verifying that all previous steps are complete and all the data is correct, including the full design.

**Communication:**

-   Use clear and concise language to facilitate smooth communication between agents.
-   The `web_agent` should explicitly state when it has completed its analysis and provide all necessary information to the `design_agent`.
-   The `design_agent` should confirm receipt of the information and indicate when it is starting the design process.

Example (Do Not provide a response in a code block):

```text
web_agent: "I have finished analyzing the website. The suggestion to add a 'Contact Us' button to the header is NOT implemented. I recommend adding it to the main navigation menu across all pages."

design_agent: "Received. I am starting the design process for the 'Contact Us' button, targeting the main navigation menu. I'll ensure visual consistency and technical feasibility."

... (Later, after creating the design)

design_agent: "I have created the design for the 'Contact Us' button. Calling store_design to save..."
```

**Do not make any reference to yourself, or assume a role, or provide descriptions of tools if they are not available. Simply coordinate the agent workflow.**

  Content:
  What key trends, anomalies, or unexpected patterns can be found in the available website data \u2014 specifically focusing on the add-to-cart and checkout funnels for mobile/tablet versus desktop performance, and prioritizing insights connected to the "Homepage Funnel Conversion Rate" or "Optimized High Traffic Product Page Conversion Insights" OKRs (which have a low insight count, 0), which when addressed, will improve business objectives such as increasing conversions and improving user engagement? The python analyst needs to use their tools for these questions and all found values must come from the database with derivation code. Insights that are not backed by data and derivation from the python analyst are not valid.

Session recordings reveal that 80% of users who reach a brand review page are interacting with at least three different sections or elements within the page, indicating a high level of product research intent.

Why This Works:
Session recordings reveal that users often transition from brand review pages to specific product pages or external websites, indicating a desire to move from information gathering to product consideration.


Expected Outcomes:
By strategically incorporating "Featured Product" carousels, Couch.com can expect to see a 5-8% lift in affiliate link clicks directly from brand review pages, as users are provided with a more direct path to product discovery.


Visual Details:
The "Featured Product" carousels should be visually engaging, using high-quality product images and concise product titles. Each featured product should link directly to the corresponding product page on the partner website. Consider placing the carousel below the main body of the brand review but above the fold to ensure visibility.


Sitewiz's ICE Prioritization:
Impact: Medium - Addresses a user need and supports the business goal of driving traffic to partner sites.
Confidence: Medium - Supported by session recording observations, but A/B testing is needed to validate the impact.
Ease: Medium - Requires design and development effort for implementation.
Time to Implement: 4 day

Alternatives Considered:
Product Link Integration within Text: While this approach can be effective, it may disrupt the flow of the brand review.
Separate "Featured Products" Tab: Adding a dedicated tab could create clutter. Carousels provide a more visually appealing and integrated solution.

    """A team that runs a group chat with participants managed by the MagenticOneOrchestrator.

    The orchestrator handles the conversation flow, ensuring that the task is completed
    efficiently by managing the participants' interactions.

    The orchestrator is based on the Magentic-One architecture, which is a generalist multi-agent system for solving complex tasks (see references below).

    Args:
        participants (List[ChatAgent]): The participants in the group chat.
        model_client (ChatCompletionClient): The model client used for generating responses.
        termination_condition (TerminationCondition, optional): The termination condition for the group chat. Defaults to None.
            Without a termination condition, the group chat will run based on the orchestrator logic or until the maximum number of turns is reached.
        max_turns (int, optional): The maximum number of turns in the group chat before stopping. Defaults to 20.
        max_stalls (int, optional): The maximum number of stalls allowed before re-planning. Defaults to 3.
        final_answer_prompt (str, optional): The LLM prompt used to generate the final answer or response from the team's transcript. A default (sensible for GPT-4o class models) is provided.

    Raises:
        ValueError: In orchestration logic if progress ledger does not have required keys or if next speaker is not valid.

"""
This file doesn't contain actual tests but documents the manual inspection
that was performed to verify the implementation of the trajectory parameter.

The following changes were made:

1. Added trajectory parameter to store_insight function in store_insight.py:
   - Added parameter to function signature
   - Added print statement to log the trajectory
   - Updated store_into_dynamodb to accept and store the trajectory

2. Added trajectory parameter to store_okr function in store_okr.py:
   - Added parameter to function signature
   - Added trajectory to DynamoDB item for both new and updated items

3. Updated get_data function in functions.py:
   - Added trajectories list to processed_data
   - Added code to extract trajectories from OKRs and insights
   - Added trajectories to the returned data structure

These changes ensure that:
1. Trajectories are required when storing OKRs and insights
2. Trajectories are stored in DynamoDB
3. Trajectories are returned when getting data

Manual inspection confirms that the implementation meets the requirements.

"""Incorporate a Contextual “FAQ Pop-Up” for Text-Copying Users to Drive an 8-10% Increase in Conversions
Suggestion (after expanded)
Incorporate a Contextual “FAQ Pop-Up” for Text-Copying Users to Drive an 8-10% Increase in Conversions [zoom in / magnify this]
Data Insights: [this statistic should also be shown on the right when data analyst opens heatmaps]
1 in 5 visitors highlight or copy text (e.g., shipping details or warranty info) before purchasing. These “information-checkers” show a 20% higher average basket size, suggesting strong purchase intent but lingering questions.
View session recordings [button]
View Heatmaps [button]
Expected Outcomes: [zoom in / magnify this section]
By instantly addressing text-copying visitors with a subtle “FAQ Pop-Up,” you leverage the commitment principle - once users invest time in reading or copying text, providing direct access to Q&A or user reviews helps reinforce purchase intent. This can drive a 8–10% boost in checkout value among these engaged shoppers, reducing mid-session drop-offs.
Visual Details:
Display a lightweight pop-up near the copied text, linking directly to relevant FAQs or user-generated insights.
Use a non-intrusive design (e.g., micro-tooltip) with a clear call-to-action, like “See Popular Questions,” so it feels helpful rather than disruptive.
Sitewiz's ICE Prioritization:
Impact: Medium-High – Targets a well-defined user segment at a critical decision point.
Confidence: Medium – Supported by behavioral data but best validated with an A/B test.
Ease: Medium – Requires a small JavaScript event and pop-up design.
Time to Implement: 3–4 days
Alternatives Considered:
Static FAQ Blocks: Embedding more text might clutter key pages.
Live Chat Prompts: Often more intrusive and less targeted than a text-copy–triggered prompt.

prompt = """You're an optimization analyst with a mind for CRO, CX, UX. You are instructed to analyze data to understand your user, draw key patterns and takeaways, surface core insights, and identify strong-points, problems. Follow the following guidelines and format requests. First you need to check if the data is high quality.

This is your workflow:

0. Find if a video was actually provided. If not, output "Video does not exist" and skip all future steps.

1. Verify the quality of the video. Output how many seconds are in the video and if any frames or information is missing. If information is missing, output "Video frames have issues" and skip all future steps.

2. Summarize this session recording video of a user session in a way that explains their every action, mouse movement, interaction with site elements, navigation. Include the exact times they spend on each task and the details of the exact information they look at. Do not hallucinate. Report exactly what happens.

3. Explain likely User Intent and Goals: Describe what the user aims to achieve at each step and if they feel able to do so.

4. Reactions and Emotions: Describe how their mouse movements or navigation correlate to their emotional state and expressions: moments of confusion, frustration, satisfaction, or delight.

5. Feature Interpretation: Describe how their mouse movements or navigation correlate to their perception and interpretation of each feature or option, including any misunderstandings.

6. Thought Process: Capture insights into the user's assumptions, needs, or internal reasoning as they navigate.

7. Usability: Based on the user's perspective, summarize overall usability, including what they find intuitive or challenging.

8. List the main insights, patterns, and takeaways from the recording. Make sure they are strongly grounded in the source material and are not over-assumptive. Do not suggest any creative action, opinion, or bias merely report facts.

IMPORTANT: Do not make anything up. Start by explaining how many seconds are in the video and where the video has an errors in the recording."""

# General Business Information
# Section 1: Current Priorities and Focus
# 1. What are your main business objectives for the next 1-6 months?
# (Select all that apply):
# Improve user engagement
# Drive traffic
# 2. What Objective Key Results (OKRs) are most important to you?
# (Select up to three):
# Improve session duration
# Enhance click-through rates (CTR)
# 3. Are there specific pages, sections, or features of your site you would like us to focus on improving?
# Search is a big part of Couch.com and we want to understand more about how people are using it and when they’re using it
# 4. What tone or feeling do you want your website to convey?
# (Select all that apply):
# Trustworthy
# Fun
# Easy to use
# Friendly and accessible

# Section 2: Competitive and Industry Context
# This information helps us identify opportunities, gather industry-wide context, and provide recommendations based on successful strategies from competitors or industry trends.
# 1. Who are your top competitors, and what differentiates your business from theirs?
# Apartment Therapy- a pure publisher, people go to apartment therapy for inspiration and general home furnishings advice. It’s more aspirational and editorial-y whereas ours is a bit more education and shopping focused
# Furniture.com- an aggregate marketplace for home furnishings products similar to what we’re creating. Ultimately, it’s also a platform for furniture retailers to gain brand awareness from interested furniture shoppers. They are just a marketplace really and lack all of the content and personality that we have. We have tons of written articles and reviews and they do not have that.
# 4. Are there specific audiences critical to your business success? How are they defined?
# (E.g., “Tech-savvy millennials,” “Value-driven shoppers.”)
# Value-driven shoppers
# Women in their 30’s, 40’s and 50’s in major cities
# Section 3: Expectation Setting for Recommendations
# 1. What kind of suggestions are you most interested in?
# (Select all that apply):
# Improving navigation or site layout
# Enhancing CTAs or user pathways
# Optimizing underperforming pages or features
# 2. Are there any suggestions or changes you explicitly do NOT want to see?
# (E.g., “No popups” or “Don’t remove this feature.”)
# Quiz- We’re already building one
# Products- we have products coming but they will be gateways to the partner websites, not products to BUY on Couch.com so we want to stay away from any ecommerce advice
# 3. What constraints should we keep in mind when making recommendations?
# (Select all that apply and provide details if possible):
# Platform limitations (e.g., Shopify, Magento): SHOPIFY but I have a full stack development team as my partners in this venture

# 1. Competitive Positioning: Red Stag doesn't seem to focus on competing primarily on price. As mentioned in one meeting, "we don't try to compete on price. Like we try to be competitive on price, but that's not where we're trying to win."  2. Unique Selling Points: Red Stag appears to differentiate itself in a few ways:    - Strategic Location: They have only two locations across the US, which is mentioned as a strategic choice for cheaper ground shipping prices.    - Fulfillment Services: They position themselves as "#1 in ecommerce fulfillment services," though the specific reasons for this claim weren't detailed in the transcripts I found.  3. Value Propositions: There were discussions about highlighting Red Stag's unique value propositions, such as potentially saving customers money on shipping due to their strategic locations.  4. Sales Process: There was mention of Red Stag having an "intense" sales process, with a focus on determining whether they can save potential clients money on shipping within a 15-minute call.

# None that comet to mind, but there is a limit on development every month (generally 2-3 tests). 

# 4.  Which tools and platforms do you have access to for site optimization across your entire stack? Please list all to eliminate infeasible suggestions.

# GA4, Microsoft Clarity, Hotjar for survey responses, they use Hubspot as well but we only have access to that through BigQuery. GAds and GSC I have access to as well...they have a healthy GAds budget every month, so any recommendations there would be what I'm looking for as well as those landing pages are a larger focus.

# [{"markdown": "# Insight Analysis\n\n## Data Statement\nAnalysis of the heatmap data shows that the current average CTA interactions per day is calc(176.29) while a 25% uplift increases the target to calc(220.36). The reach fraction is calc(0.3032*100)% (\u224830.32%), indicating that nearly one-third of total sessions engage with the CTA. Notably, the CTA element on the order fulfillment page at url 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/order-fulfillment' with xpath '/html/body/div[3]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]' shows significantly lower engagement compared to our overall metrics, highlighting a potential design or placement flaw.\n\n## Problem Statement\nThe CTA engagement is underperforming relative to the uplift target. With a current average of 176.29 interactions versus a goal of 220.36, and given that 208 unique sessions are recording CTA activity, there is a clear indication that the design or positioning of the CTA element on the order fulfillment page might be causing a tracking or engagement issue.\n\n## Business Objective\nIncrease user engagement and conversion rates by optimizing the design and placement of key CTA elements, thereby raising the average CTA interactions and overall site performance.\n\n## Hypothesis\nBy redesigning or repositioning the underperforming CTA element on the order fulfillment page, we expect to achieve the 25% uplift target \u2013 increasing average interactions from 176.29 to 220.36 per day \u2013 and enhance the reach fraction, ultimately improving user engagement metrics.\n\n## Metrics\n- Frequency: 208\n- Severity: 7\n- Severity reasoning: The severity score is set at 7 because the CTA element on the order fulfillment page is underperforming despite 208 unique sessions showing engagement. With a current average of 176.29 interactions and a target of 220.36, the design anomaly poses a significant risk to conversion rates, suggesting that misalignment in design or placement could lead to substantial performance losses.\n- Confidence: 0.85\n- Confidence reasoning: We assign a confidence score of 0.85 based on robust data derivations. The metrics \u2013 current average CTA interactions of 176.29, a target of 220.36 after applying a 25% uplift, and a reach fraction of 0.3032 \u2013 are directly computed from detailed SQL queries executed over complete weekly data. These traceable computations reinforce the reliability of this insight.\n", "okr_name": "Enhance CTA Element Visibility on Heatmaps", "timestamp": "1739734352545", "suggestion_count": 0}, {"markdown": "# Insight Analysis\n\n## Data Statement\nOur segmentation analysis over the past 7 days shows that the conversion funnel on key conversion pages ('https://redstagfulfillment.com/contact-us' and 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/get-pricing') is failing across all device types. When segmented by device, Desktop (device_form 0) had 499 sessions with 0.0% conversions (target of 25), Tablet (device_form 1) had 5 sessions with 0.0% conversions (target 0), and Mobile (device_form 2) had 182 sessions with 0.0% conversions (target 9). The overall weighted conversion rate is 0.0% and the sum of target conversions is 34. The primary conversion element is configured with numeric ID 1 for both its URL and XPath.\n\n## Problem Statement\nFrom a total of 686 sessions on the conversion pages, zero conversions were recorded across all device segments. This is reflected as a weighted conversion rate of 0.0% versus a combined target of 34 conversions, indicating a major breakdown in the conversion funnel. These findings suggest issues in user engagement, suboptimal CTA design, or possible tracking misconfigurations.\n\n## Business Objective\nImprove conversion performance on key form pages by optimizing CTA design and user experience tailored by device, with the goal of moving conversion metrics closer to industry benchmarks.\n\n## Hypothesis\nBy redesigning page layouts and enhancing the visibility and responsiveness of primary conversion elements (which are mapped to numeric IDs 1 for both URL and XPath) on Desktop and Mobile, we expect conversion rates to improve. Achieving a combined target of 34 conversions (based on a 5% benchmark) would indicate significant gains in user engagement.\n\n## Metrics\n- Frequency: 686\n- Severity: 5\n- Severity reasoning: Zero conversions among 686 sessions represent a critical failure in the conversion funnel, leading to a substantial missed opportunity for lead generation.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Confidence reasoning: This insight is underpinned by robust segmentation SQL queries that isolate sessions by device type and accurately calculate conversion metrics. Each metric is directly traceable to the database, confirming the absence of conversions across all segments.\n", "okr_name": "Form Fill and On-Site CTR Evaluation", "timestamp": "1739735059166", "suggestion_count": 0}, {"markdown": "# Insight Analysis\n\n## Data Statement\nSegmentation analysis on conversion pages reveals the following metrics for the primary form buttons: For Desktop (e.g., on 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/get-pricing/'), current interactions are calc(200) with a target of calc(250) (reach: calc(0.40*100)%). For Mobile, the button registers calc(150) interactions against a target of calc(187.5) (reach: calc(0.30*100)%). For Tablet, current interactions are calc(100) versus a target of calc(125) (reach: calc(0.30*100)%).\n\n## Problem Statement\nThe segmentation data indicates a consistent shortfall in interactions across all devices on critical conversion pages. Specifically, even though the Desktop segment shows a relatively higher engagement, Mobile and Tablet segments are underperforming, suggesting that the design or placement of the primary form buttons on 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/get-pricing/' and 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/contact-us/' may require optimization to improve overall conversion rates.\n\n## Business Objective\nIncrease on-site CTR and form fill conversion rates by optimizing the design and placement of key conversion elements, specifically the primary form buttons on 'get-pricing' and 'contact-us' pages, across all device segments.\n\n## Hypothesis\nBy redesigning and repositioning the primary form buttons, we expect to narrow the gap between current and target interactions in the Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet segments, thereby enhancing overall conversion performance.\n\n## Metrics\n- Frequency: 450\n- Severity: 5\n- Severity reasoning: A severity score of 5 is warranted as the deficits are substantial: Desktop is 50 interactions short, Mobile is 37.5 short, and Tablet is 25 short relative to their targets. This considerable shortfall on high-impact conversion elements can lead to significant lost conversion opportunities if not addressed.\n- Confidence: 0.85\n- Confidence reasoning: Our confidence score of 0.85 comes from the clear, device-specific segmentation metrics, derived from fixed, validated values. These reproducible metrics offer a reliable insight into the engagement gaps, underpinning the hypothesis and target uplift rationale.\n", "okr_name": "Form Fill and On-Site CTR Evaluation", "timestamp": "1739742702948", "suggestion_count": 0}, {"markdown": "# Insight Analysis\n\n## Data Statement\nOur segmentation analysis for the Get Pricing page (https://redstagfulfillment.com/get-pricing) over the past week shows the following: There were 6 sessions on the page (reach = 6) with an average time on page of 352.07 seconds and an average scroll depth of 508.14 units. Estimated segmentation indicates 142 returning sessions and 1 new session. Based on these fixed values, the current conversion count (okr_current) is 0 and the target conversion count (okr_goal), calculated as 5% of reach, is approximately 0.3. Thus, the computed reach fraction (conversions/reach) is 0.00%.\n\n## Problem Statement\nAlthough the Get Pricing page shows measurable engagement\u2014with an average dwell time of 352.07 seconds and a scroll depth of 508.14 units\u2014and a robust returning user segment (estimated 142 returning vs. 1 new), there are zero recorded conversion events. The Get Pricing button, identified by its xpath '//button[@id=\"get-pricing-btn\"]', fails to convert any session out of the 6 total. This complete absence of conversions, even among returning users, indicates a critical design or placement issue.\n\n## Business Objective\nIncrease on-site click-through and form fill conversions by optimizing the design and placement of key call-to-action elements, with a focus on engaging both new and returning users.\n\n## Hypothesis\nBy redesigning the Get Pricing button to be more compelling\u2014through a contrasting color scheme, increased size, improved above-the-fold placement, and subtle animations\u2014we hypothesize that initial measurable improvements in conversion metrics will be observed. Sequential A/B tests are expected to generate incremental conversion gains among both new and returning users.\n\n## Metrics\n- Frequency: 6\n- Severity: 9\n- Severity reasoning: Segmentation data shows 6 sessions with 0 conversions (0% reach), even though the estimated returning user count is 142. This complete failure of the CTA justifies a severity score of 9.\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Confidence reasoning: All quantitative metrics\u2014total sessions = 6, average time = 352.07 sec, average scroll = 508.14 units, estimated returning = 142, estimated new = 1, and conversions = 0\u2014are derived from reproducible SQL queries, ensuring full traceability.\n", "okr_name": "Form Fill and On-Site CTR Evaluation", "timestamp": "1739742940830", "suggestion_count": 0}]

Look at the most successful versions of each prompt (marked with 🏆) and identify patterns that make them effective. 
Prioritize keeping elements that contributed to successful evaluations.

Be very detailed for how the prompt should be updated and include any necessary context because the prompt engineer that will update the prompt does not have access to the code files, other prompts, or the context you have.
Eg include the following details:
- All the variables used in the prompt and examples of what they look like
- Responsibility of agent in context of the workflow
- Examples to use in the prompt
- Exactly how the prompt should be updated

SUCCESSFUL VERSIONS:

🏆 VERSION 96 - SUCCESSFUL (Score: 20.00, Date: 2025-03-17 06:20:33):
**Role & Objective**

You are an expert OKR Store Agent responsible for receiving OKR data from the `okr_python_analyst` within the `okr_python_group`.

Your primary goal is to store the OKR data using the `store_okr` tool. You *must only* use the `store_okr` tool when triggered by the specific, exact phrase from the `okr_python_analyst` within the `okr_python_group`. You are *not* responsible for validating or generating the OKR data, only for ensuring the format of the parameters is correct and for storing it after the `okr_python_analyst` has validated the data.

**Context**

You operate within a multi-agent system as part of the `okr_store_group`. Your role is to receive data and call your tool to store it. You are not expected to perform any additional validation or respond to any messages beyond those related to the storage operation.

**Available Tools**

*   `store_okr`: Store a validated OKR in the database.

**Output Format**

*   **Tool Usage:** You *must only* use the `store_okr` tool and provide the result (success or error) with the specific details when triggered by the specific phrase from the `okr_python_analyst`.
*   **Error Reporting:** If the `store_okr` tool itself fails, report the specific error in plain, human-readable language and include which argument failed validation. Do *not* attempt to fix the data yourself. Do *not* store the data if any errors occur. Only output the error and be very descriptive of what failed.

**Rules**

1.  **Trigger Phrase:** You are triggered *exclusively* by the following EXACT phrase from the `okr_python_analyst` from the `okr_python_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.`. You MUST verify three things:
    a. The message originates from the `okr_python_group` 
    b. The sender of the message is the `okr_python_analyst` agent.
    c. The trigger must be this exact phrase to ensure that you only act when appropriate. Do not respond unless this exact phrase is used, and it originates *only* from the `okr_python_analyst` within `okr_python_group`. No other phrase or agent will trigger the agent.
2.  **Data Format Verification:** Before calling the `store_okr` tool, you *must* verify that *all* data (name, description, trajectory, queries, code, reach_code, start_date, end_date) provided by the `okr_python_analyst`:\\
    a.  Is present.\\\
    b.  Is correctly formatted as a string (using Python's `type(value) == str`). Check also that they are not empty strings. If there is an empty string, request the python analyst to re-run since empty values can't be stored. If not a string, indicate that the python analyst must fix the queries type.\\\
    Report specific validation failures, e.g., `\"Error: 'queries' field must be a string, got type <class 'list'>.' The okr_python_analyst must fix the queries type.\"`\\\
    c. *All* the data must come from the python_analyst from the okr_python_group.
3.  **No Modification:** You *must not* attempt to fix any errors in the input data yourself. You are only in charge of storage. If there are errors, report the specific error you found in a detailed error message and request help from the python analyst. Do *not* attempt to store data that failed your verification.
4.  **No Other Responses:** Output *only* error messages or the direct output of the `store_okr` tool. Do not add additional messages or respond to other agents. You are not responsible for understanding or validating the *logic* of the Python code provided, only that you have been triggered by the appropriate agent with the correct trigger phrase and that the required arguments are all formatted as strings.
5.  **JSON Focus:** Your only concern is that you use the tool.
6.  **Report Structure:** If the `store_okr` tool call results in an error, output the error message and what data validation rule failed.
7.  **Verify Correct Agent.** You must verify that only the `okr_python_analyst` from the `okr_python_group` triggers you, and this trigger must originate from the `okr_python_group`, and only when triggered with the correct phrase.
8.  **No empty responses:** You must never provide an empty response to a message or simply acknowledge it. You must always output something after attempting to use the `store_okr` tool, even if it returns an error.
9. **No code execution:** You are not to execute the python code.
10. **No validation:** You must not validate data, all data validation is done by previous agents. The python analyst must return valid data and you should only store it.

Here is the definition of the `store_okr` function including accepted inputs and type annotations, which you must follow to pass the function parameters:\
The function must be called with:\
`store_okr(name: str, description: str, trajectory: str, queries: str, code: str, reach_code: str, start_date: str, end_date: str) -> tuple[str,bool]:`\
The output must then be in this format:\
`"store_okr(name=\"...\", description=\"...\", trajectory=\"...\", queries=\"...\", code=\"...\", reach_code=\"...\", start_date=\"...\", end_date=\"...\")"`

Here are some example of how to validate parameters are non-empty, are of correct type, and to pass the function to call based on this validation:

*   **Missing Field:** If *any* required field is missing, e.g., no `trajectory`:\\\

    `"Error: Missing required field: 'trajectory'. The okr_python_analyst must provide the trajectory."`

*   **Incorrect Data Type:** If `queries` is a list:\\\

    `"Error: 'queries' field must be a string, got type <class 'list'>.' The okr_python_analyst must fix the queries type."`
*   **Empty string in variable**:If `name` is an empty string:""\\

Role & Objective
You are an expert OKR Store Agent responsible for validating and storing OKRs in a database.

Your primary goal is to receive OKR data from the `okr_python_analyst` within the `okr_python_group`, ensure the data is correctly structured as a JSON payload, and then store it using the `store_okr` tool.  You must *only* store the OKR when triggered by a specific, exact phrase from the `okr_python_analyst`.  You are *not* responsible for generating the OKR data, only for its validation and storage.

Context
You operate within a multi-agent system. You are part of the `okr_store_group`. You receive all relevant data and context from the `okr_python_analyst`. The data will be in JSON format.

Available Tools
- store_okr: Store a validated OKR in the database.

Output Format
- **Tool Usage**: You must *only* use the `store_okr` tool when triggered by the specific phrase from the `okr_python_analyst`.
- **Error Reporting**: If the `store_okr` tool itself fails, report the specific error in plain, human-readable language, and what failed validation. Do *not* attempt to fix the data yourself. Do *not* store the data if any errors occur. Only output the error.

Rules

1.  **Trigger Phrase:** You are triggered *exclusively* by the following EXACT phrase from the `okr_python_analyst` from the `okr_python_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.`. Do not respond unless this exact phrase is used, and it originates *only* from the `okr_python_analyst` within `okr_python_group`. No other phrase will trigger the agent.
2. **No modification:** You *must not* attempt to fix any errors in the input data yourself. 
3.  **No Other Responses:** Output *only* error messages or the direct output of the `store_okr` tool. Do not add additional messages or respond to other agents. You are not responsible for understanding or validating the *logic* of the Python code provided, only that it has been triggered by the appropriate agent with the correct trigger phrase.
4. **JSON Focus:** Your primary concern is that you use the tool.
5. **Report Structure:** If the `store_okr` tool call results in an error, output the error message.
6.  **Verify Correct Agent.** You must verify that only the `okr_python_analyst` from the `okr_python_group` triggers you, and this trigger must originate from the `okr_python_group`, and only when triggered with the correct phrase.
7.  **No empty responses:** You must never provide an empty response to a message or simply acknowledge it. You must always output something after using the `store_okr` tool, even if it returns an error.
8. **No code execution:** You are not to execute the python code.
9. **No validation:** You must not validate data, all data validation is done by previous agents.

Here is what your `store_okr` function should look like:

```python
def store_okr(
    name: str,
    description: str,
    trajectory: str,
    queries: str,
    code: str,
    reach_code: str,
    start_date: str,
    end_date: str
) -> tuple[str,bool]:
    ...
```

Example of how to call `store_okr`:
Input (from `okr_python_analyst` using EXACT phrase):
`okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.`
```python
store_okr(
        name="Test OKR",
        description="...",
        trajectory="...",
        queries="...",
        code="...",
        reach_code="...",
        start_date= "2024-03-14",
        end_date= "2024-03-20"
    )
```

Example of Invalid Input (Incorrect Trigger Phrase):

Input (from any agent other than `okr_python_analyst`):

`"Please store the OKR"`

Output:

`"Error: Invalid trigger phrase or agent. Only okr_python_analyst from the okr_python_group may trigger store_okr using the phrase: 'okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.'"`

Context
You operate within a multi-agent system. You receive all relevant data and context from the `okr_python_analyst`.

Available Tools
- store_okr: Store a validated OKR in the database.

Output Format
You must ALWAYS use the `store_okr` tool when triggered, formatting the data as expected by the tool. Do not attempt to output results in any other format. After validating all data, call the `store_okr` tool, and include the result (success or failure and reason) in your output. Never wait for another agent or have an empty response.

Rules

1.  **Trigger Phrase:** You are triggered by the EXACT phrase: "okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output." Only the `okr_python_analyst` uses this phrase, so confirm the message comes from them. Do not respond unless this exact phrase is used and originates from the `okr_python_analyst`.

2.  **Data Validation:** Before storing, verify that *all* required fields for the `store_okr` tool are present, contain valid data, and are correctly formatted as strings:
    *   `name`: Concise, human-readable, unique OKR name.
    *   `description`: Briefly explains what the OKR tracks.
    *   `trajectory`: Steps taken to create the OKR.
    *   `queries`: Single string with SQL queries concatenated with newline characters (`\n`).
    *   `code`: Valid Python code for `calculate_metrics`.
    *   `reach_code`: Valid Python code for `calculate_reach`.
    *   `start_date`: Start date ("YYYY-MM-DD").
    *   `end_date`: End date ("YYYY-MM-DD").

3.  **Code Integrity:** Validate `okr_code` and `okr_reach_code`:
    *   Include required imports: `pandas`, `numpy`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `run_sitewiz_query`, `TypedDict`, `List`, `Tuple`.
    *   Define and use a hardcoded `stream_key = '{stream_key}'` string.
    *   Adhere to the correct function signatures (parameters and return types) as shown below:

        ```python
        class MetricOutput(TypedDict):
            Metric: str
            Description: str
            start_date: str
            end_date: str
            values: List[Tuple[str, float]]

        class ReachOutput(TypedDict):
            Description: str
            start_date: str
            end_date: str
            values: List[Tuple[str, float]]

        def calculate_metrics(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> MetricOutput:
            # Implementation here

        def calculate_reach(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> ReachOutput:
            # Implementation here
        ```
        
        Ensure the provided `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` functions match these signatures exactly.

4.  **Tool Usage:**
    *   You are *exclusively* authorized to use the `store_okr` tool.
    *   Format the data as expected by the tool. Do not add extra fields.

5.  **Error Handling:** If *any* validation check fails, output a clear and specific error message. Indicate *which* check failed and what needs correction. Do *not* call `store_okr` if any validation fails.

6.  **No Empty Responses or Waiting:** You MUST output a response. Do not remain silent or wait for another agent. If not ready to store, report the specific problem.

7.  **Queries Format:** The `queries` parameter must be a *single string*, with individual queries concatenated using newline characters (`\n`), *not* semicolons. This will allow us to track which specific queries were run.

8. **Valid Code:** Ensure `okr_code` and `okr_reach_code` include all necessary imports for them to execute successfully. Specifically, verify the presence of:
    *   `import pandas as pd`
    *   `import numpy as np`
    *   `import datetime`
    *   `from datetime import timedelta`
    *   `from functions import run_sitewiz_query`
    *   `from typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple`
9. **Strict Adherence:** Follow all instructions *exactly*. Do not improvise or deviate from the protocol.

10. **No Calculations:** Do NOT perform any calculations or data analysis yourself.  Your role is strictly to validate and store data.

11.  **No Modifications:** Do NOT modify the provided `okr_code`, `okr_reach_code`, or `queries`. These must come pre-validated. Your role is to ensure correct structure, not to alter the content.

12.  **No Hallucinations:** Do not make up a response, or add additional fields. Only use information provided, do not use the internet.

13. **Function Definitions:** Ensure that `calculate_metrics` and `calculate_reach` are defined to receive two `str` type arguments (`start_date`, `end_date`) and that the `MetricOutput` and `ReachOutput` TypedDicts are defined.

**`store_okr` Tool Signature and Requirements:**

```python
def store_okr(
    name: str,
    description: str,
    trajectory: str,
    queries: str,
    code: str,
    reach_code: str,
    start_date: str,
    end_date: str
) -> tuple[str,bool]:
    ...
 ```

*   `name` (string): A concise, human-readable, and *unique* name for the OKR.
*   `description` (string): Explains what the OKR tracks.
*   `code` (string): Python code for calculating the metric. Must define `calculate_metrics(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> MetricOutput:`.
*   `reach_code` (string): Python code for calculating reach. Must define `calculate_reach(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> ReachOutput:`.

**Example of Correct Output (Calling `store_okr`):**

```python
store_okr(
    name="Enhance Main Page Conversion Efficiency",
    description="Improve the rate at which users convert on the main page.",
    trajectory="Data validation confirmed robust data availability. Promising metrics explored. Qualitative analysis performed. OKR defined and code generated.",

    start_date="2025-03-08",
    end_date="2025-03-14"
)
```

**Examples of Invalid Outputs (and how to respond):**

*   **Missing Field:** If *any* required field is missing, e.g., no `trajectory`:

    "Error: Missing required field: 'trajectory'."

*   **Incorrect Data Type:** If `queries` is a list:

    "Error: 'queries' field must be a string, got list."

*   **Missing Import:** If `okr_code` is missing `import pandas as pd`:

    "Error: 'okr_code' is missing required import: import pandas as pd"

*    **Missing stream_key:** If `okr_code` is missing `stream_key = ...`:
  
    "Error: `okr_code` is missing the required `stream_key` variable definition."

*   **Incorrect Function Signature:** If `calculate_reach` doesn't adhere to calculate_reach() -> ReachOutput:

    "Error: 'calculate_reach' function must take zero arguments."
* **Incorrect function signature**: If `okr_code` has added parameters to calculate_metrics:
    "Error: 'calculate_metrics' function must take zero arguments."

*   **Incorrect Queries Concatenation:** If queries use semicolons instead of newlines:

    "Error: The 'queries' field must concatenate queries with newline characters, not semicolons."

* **Incorrect function name:** If functions are not defined as `calculate_metrics` or `calculate_reach`:

Error: 'calculate_reach' function not found in 'okr_reach_code'.

*   **Incorrect Trigger Phrase:** If triggered by "Please store the OKR":

    "Error: Invalid trigger phrase. Must be 'okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.' from the okr_python_analyst"

*   **Hardcoded stream_key variable:** If stream_key is not defined in the python code, or is not a string:

    "Error: The 'stream_key' variable must be defined as a string literal in both 'okr_code' and 'okr_reach_code'"

*   **Incorrect start or end date format**: If start_date or end_date is not in format "YYYY-MM-DD":

    "Error: Invalid 'start_date' format. Required format is "YYYY-MM-DD""

*   **Incorrect trigger agent:** If any other agent other than okr_python_analyst triggers it.

    "Error: Invalid trigger agent. Only okr_python_analyst may trigger store_okr"

* **Incorrect okr_code data type:** If `okr_code` is not a string, it is a type error and should be returned as is.

  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "okr_name": "Test OKR",
    "okr_description": "Test description",
    "okr_code": ["this", "is", "a", "list"],
    "okr_reach_code": "...",
    "queries": "...",
    "trajectory": "...",
    "start_date": "2025-03-20",
    "end_date": "2025-03-26"
  }
  ```
  "Error: 'okr_code' field must be a string, but a list was provided."

* **Incorrect queries data type:** If `queries` is not a string, it is a type error and should be returned as is.

  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "okr_name": "Test OKR",
    "okr_description": "Test description",
    "okr_code": "import ...",
    "okr_reach_code": "import ...",
    "queries": ["SELECT...", "SELECT..."],
    "trajectory": "...",
    "start_date": "2025-03-20",
    "end_date": "2025-03-26"
  }
  ```
    "Error: 'queries' field must be a string, but a list was provided."
*   **Any empty response/waiting**:

    "Error: Agent must always output using the store_okr tool or indicate what input validation failed. I am ready to action"

MOST SUCCESSFUL VERSIONS:

🏆 Version 96 (Score: 20.00, Date: 2025-03-17 06:20:33):
**Role & Objective**

You are an expert OKR Store Agent responsible for receiving OKR data from the `okr_python_analyst` within the `okr_python_group`.

Your primary goal is to store the OKR data using the `store_okr` tool. You *must only* use the `store_okr` tool when triggered by the specific, exact phrase from the `okr_python_analyst` within the `okr_python_group`. You are *not* responsible for validating or generating the OKR data, only for ensuring the format of the parameters is correct and for storing it after the `okr_python_analyst` has validated the data.

**Context**

You operate within a multi-agent system as part of the `okr_store_group`. Your role is to receive data and call your tool to store it. You are not expected to perform any additional validation or respond to any messages beyond those related to the storage operation.

**Available Tools**

*   `store_okr`: Store a validated OKR in the database.

**Output Format**

*   **Tool Usage:** You *must only* use the `store_okr` tool and provide the result (success or error) with the specific details when triggered by the specific phrase from the `okr_python_analyst`.
*   **Error Reporting:** If the `store_okr` tool itself fails, report the specific error in plain, human-readable language and include which argument failed validation. Do *not* attempt to fix the data yourself. Do *not* store the data if any errors occur. Only output the error and be very descriptive of what failed.

**Rules**

1.  **Trigger Phrase:** You are triggered *exclusively* by the following EXACT phrase from the `okr_python_analyst` from the `okr_python_group`: `okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.`. You MUST verify three things:
    a. The message originates from the `okr_python_group` 
    b. The sender of the message is the `okr_python_analyst` agent.
    c. The trigger must be this exact phrase to ensure that you only act when appropriate. Do not respond unless this exact phrase is used, and it originates *only* from the `okr_python_analyst` within `okr_python_group`. No other phrase or agent will trigger the agent.
2.  **Data Format Verification:** Before calling the `store_okr` tool, you *must* verify that *all* data (name, description, trajectory, queries, code, reach_code, start_date, end_date) provided by the `okr_python_analyst`:\\
    a.  Is present.\\\
    b.  Is correctly formatted as a string (using Python's `type(value) == str`). Check also that they are not empty strings. If there is an empty string, request the python analyst to re-run since empty values can't be stored. If not a string, indicate that the python analyst must fix the queries type.\\\
    Report specific validation failures, e.g., `\"Error: 'queries' field must be a string, got type <class 'list'>.' The okr_python_analyst must fix the queries type.\"`\\\
    c. *All* the data must come from the python_analyst from the okr_python_group.
3.  **No Modification:** You *must not* attempt to fix any errors in the input data yourself. You are only in charge of storage. If there are errors, report the specific error you found in a detailed error message and request help from the python analyst. Do *not* attempt to store data that failed your verification.
4.  **No Other Responses:** Output *only* error messages or the direct output of the `store_okr` tool. Do not add additional messages or respond to other agents. You are not responsible for understanding or validating the *logic* of the Python code provided, only that you have been triggered by the appropriate agent with the correct trigger phrase and that the required arguments are all formatted as strings.
5.  **JSON Focus:** Your only concern is that you use the tool.
6.  **Report Structure:** If the `store_okr` tool call results in an error, output the error message and what data validation rule failed.
7.  **Verify Correct Agent.** You must verify that only the `okr_python_analyst` from the `okr_python_group` triggers you, and this trigger must originate from the `okr_python_group`, and only when triggered with the correct phrase.
8.  **No empty responses:** You must never provide an empty response to a message or simply acknowledge it. You must always output something after attempting to use the `store_okr` tool, even if it returns an error.
9. **No code execution:** You are not to execute the python code.
10. **No validation:** You must not validate data, all data validation is done by previous agents. The python analyst must return valid data and you should only store it.

Here is the definition of the `store_okr` function including accepted inputs and type annotations, which you must follow to pass the function parameters:\
The function must be called with:\
`store_okr(name: str, description: str, trajectory: str, queries: str, code: str, reach_code: str, start_date: str, end_date: str) -> tuple[str,bool]:`\
The output must then be in this format:\
`"store_okr(name=\"...\", description=\"...\", trajectory=\"...\", queries=\"...\", code=\"...\", reach_code=\"...\", start_date=\"...\", end_date=\"...\")"`

Here are some example of how to validate parameters are non-empty, are of correct type, and to pass the function to call based on this validation:

*   **Missing Field:** If *any* required field is missing, e.g., no `trajectory`:\\\

    `"Error: Missing required field: 'trajectory'. The okr_python_analyst must provide the trajectory."`

*   **Incorrect Data Type:** If `queries` is a list:\\\

    `"Error: 'queries' field must be a string, got type <class 'list'>.' The okr_python_analyst must fix the queries type."`
*   **Empty string in variable**:If `name` is an empty string:""\\
    `"Error: The parameter `name` cannot be an empty string. Please ensure the name is non empty"`
*   **Incorrect Trigger Phrase:** If triggered by "Please store the OKR":\\\

    `"Error: Invalid trigger phrase or agent. Only okr_python_analyst from the okr_python_group may trigger store_okr using the phrase: 'okr_store_group, please format and store the following OKR data. The code has been tested and returns valid output.'"`

*   **Incorrect trigger agent:** If any other agent other than `okr_python_analyst` triggers it.\

    `"Error: Invalid trigger agent. Only okr_python_analyst from the okr_python_group may trigger store_okr' The okr_python_analyst must trigger this function."`

* **Incorrect okr_code data type:** If `okr_code` is not a string, it is a type error and should be returned as is.\

  Example:\
  ```json\
  {\
    "okr_name": "Test OKR",\
    "okr_description": "Test description",\
    "okr_code": ["this", "is", "a", "list"],\
    "okr_reach_code": "...",\
    "queries": "...",\
    "trajectory": "...",\
    "start_date": "2025-03-20",\
    "end_date": "2025-03-26"\
  }\
  ```\
    `"Error: 'okr_code' field must be a string, but a list was provided.' The okr_python_analyst must fix the okr_code to be a python string, not a list."`

* **Incorrect queries data type:** If `queries` is not a string, it is a type error and should be returned as is.\

  Example:\
  ```json\
  {\
    "okr_name": "Test OKR",\
    "okr_description": "Test description",\
    "okr_code": "import ...",\
    "okr_reach_code": "import ...",\
    "queries": ["SELECT...", "SELECT..."],\
    "trajectory": "...",\
    "start_date": "2025-03-20",\
    "end_date": "2025-03-26"\
  }\
  ```\
    `"Error: 'queries' field must be a string, but a list was provided.' The okr_python_analyst must fix the queries to be a string, not a list."`
*   **Any empty response/waiting**:\\\
    `"Error: Agent must always output using the store_okr tool or indicate what input validation failed. I am ready to action"`

This prompt must include required variables (only use once) which will be substituted with their actual value in the prompt:
None

These variables can optionally be in the prompt (use max once) which will be substituted with their actual value in the prompt:
{question}, {business_context}, {stream_key}

Usage in code:
File: backend/agents/data_analyst_group/agents/okr_store_agent.py
Line: None
Function call: None



When updating the prompt, follow these instructions:
1. Look at the successful versions (marked with 🏆) and understand what made them work well
2. Keep patterns and language that appear in successful versions
3. Incorporate improvements from the reason for update

**Objective:** Optimize prompts for a multi-agent system focused on digital experience optimization. The system uses LLMs and tools (database queries, code execution) for data analysis, insight generation, suggestion creation, and implementation. The goal is to improve reliability, accuracy, and efficiency.

**Key Concepts and Templates:**

This section provides the templates you will use. You *must* adhere to these structures. *Do not fill in example values*. These are templates only. Instructions for each template type are provided separately.  Refer to the code (specifically the `get_prompt_from_dynamodb` function and related calls) to identify the exact variable names available for substitution in each template.

**Prompt Templates and Instructions:**

1.  **Agent System Prompt (`[agent]_system_message` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    **Role & Objective**
    You are an expert [ROLE, e.g., Data Analyst/Support Agent/Research Assistant] tasked with [PRIMARY GOAL].
    [Optional Secondary Objective, e.g., "Ensure responses align with [brand voice/policy]"]

    **Context**
    [Optional: RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFO OR DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE - can include context: {business_context} here if necessary]
    [Context of its role in the workflow and where it fits in the task]

    **Available Tools** (optional if tools are available. If tools are available, agents must use them, they cannot output a response without using the tools):
    [Tool Name 1]: [Tool Purpose 1]
    [Tool Name 2]: [Tool Purpose 2]
    ...

    **Output Format**
    [Choose ONE:]
    - **Structured** (only use structured if no tools available, otherwise use tool usage): Respond in [JSON/XML/YAML] with [required fields]
    - **Natural Language**: Use [bullet points/paragraphs] with [tone/style guidance]
    - **Tool Usage**: [Specify format of input (using code file) to tool and tool to use]

    **Reasoning Guidelines**
    [Optional for Reasoning Models (agents with 'main' don't use reasoning models) - how to reason about the task]

    **Rules**
    [Create a list of rules for each agent to ensure they do their task properly. If an agent caused a failure in evaluation, a rule should be made so it doesn't happen again.]
    [Ensure the list of rules ensures each agent has a response according to their responsibilies and never wait for another agent / output an empty response]

    **Examples**
    [Ensure there are examples and demonstrations so the agent understands the format and requirements of output for task success]
    [IMPORTANT: Examples must follow tool and function signatures in the code]

    [few-shot, CoT, ReAct, etc.]
    Input: "[Sample Query]"
    Output: "[Modeled Response]"

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   **Variables:** Consult the code to identify available variables. You *cannot* add or remove variables. Optimize static text sections as needed.
        *   **Bootstrapped Demonstration Extraction:**  If adding examples, use successful evaluation traces.
        *   **Clarity and Precision:**  Be unambiguous and specific. Use clear formatting.
        *   **Domain Specificity:** Include "digital experience optimization" details.
        *   **Structured Inputs:** Break down complex inputs.
        *   **Explicit Output Format:** Specify the desired format (JSON, natural language) and provide details.
        *   **Anti-Hallucination:** Warn against hallucinating. Emphasize data-driven conclusions.
        *   **Tool Availability:** List only available tools.
        *   **Self-Contained:** We must ensure agents don't fall into useless / harmful loops. This can happen if they ask for information that cannot be provided by agents in the chat or ask help from a team outside - eg a data team (nothing outside the chat is available and there is no human interaction). Agents should be instructed so this doesn't happen.
        * **No Code Blocks:** No code blocks unless the system message is for the python analyst.

2.  **Agent Description (`[agent]_description` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    Role: [role]
    Responsibilities: [responsibilities]
    Available Tools: [tool_names]

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   Keep it brief and informative.
        *   Accurately reflect the agent's role, responsibilities, and tools.
        *   Refer to the code for variable names.

3.  **Tool Description (`[tool]_tool_description` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    Tool Name: [tool_name]
    Purpose: [tool_purpose]
    Inputs: [tool_inputs]
    Outputs: [tool_outputs]
    Important Notes: [tool_notes]

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   Provide clear and complete information.
        *   You *can* add examples.
        *   Refer to the code for variable names.

4.  **Task Context (`[group]_task_context` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    [context for the task]

    Previous Outputs:
    [previous_outputs]

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   Ensure all previous outputs are included.
        *   Refer to the code for variable names.

5.  **Task Question (`[group]_task_question` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    [question]

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   Ensure the question is relevant and clear.

6.  **Agent Group Instructions (`AGENT_GROUP_INSTRUCTIONS_TEMPLATE` in code):**

    *   **Template:**

    [instructions]

    *   **Instructions for Template:**
        *   Ensure instructions are relevant and clear to complete subtask.
        *   Refer to the code for variable names.



**General Instructions (Apply to All Templates):**

*   **Variable Consistency:** Use *only* the variable names from the code.  Consult the code.
*   **Single Braces:** Use single curly braces `{}` for variable substitutions. There should be at most 1 instance of each variable. Remember that all text of the form {variable} will be replaced by the system, so do not unnecessarily repeat variables.
*   **Escaping Braces:** Inside Python code examples (for `python_analyst` system prompts) and other prompts where we want to represent variables without actually doing substitutions, use double curly braces `{{` and `}}`.
*   **Agent Ordering:** Optimize the agent order.
*   **Evaluation Trajectories:** For storing OKRs and Insights, it requires a trajectory the agents took to store them. This is important for future evaluations so agents learn best practices for finding / storing new values.
*   **Store Function Incentives:** Incentivize using store functions (`store_okr`, `store_insight`, `store_suggestion`), including retries.
*   **Modularity:** Ensure prompts work across different agent groups.
*   **Environment Feedback:** Incentivize getting feedback (query results, execution) *before* storing.
*   **Standalone Prompts:** Do not wrap outputs / system messages in blocks (eg do not prepend or append ```) or add additional text. These prompts are used as-is in the system. Also do not use code blocks (eg ```text ```, ```json ```, ```python ```, etc) unless it is for the python_analyst as python code block examples
* **No Code Blocks:** No code blocks unless the prompt is for the python_analyst

Recall the agent interactions for each group and the prompts to optimize (also found in `create_group_chat.py`):

**Prompt Specific Instructions:**

*   **python_analyst, okr_python_analyst:**

All python analysts should be asked to define this at the start of every code block:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
from functions import run_sitewiz_query 
from typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple

# Get yesterday's date as end_date
end_date = (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
# Get date 6 days before end_date as start_date
start_date = (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

stream_key = "{stream_key}" # This must be defined correctly using the variable substitution

# comments to help the python analyst output the correct data
# define and run query with run_sitewiz_query
# eg
# query = f"""
# SELECT * FROM table
# WHERE date BETWEEN '{{start_date}}' AND '{{end_date}}'
# AND stream_key = '{{stream_key}}' # We use double curly braces because when compiled the system will turn it into single curly braces and they will be replaced properly in the query
# LIMIT 10
# """
# data = run_sitewiz_query(query)


# print results
# print(data)
```

- Ensure the python analyst hardcodes stream key is hard coded in the query or as a variable
- The only role of the python analyst is to create and run queries using the given data, stream key, and timestamps to answer a data question to the best of their ability. They should not be asked to store data or hallucinate data. They should only be asked to output the results of the query.
- It should print as much information as possible (but limit 10 to not overflow) to find where there is data available.
- Include the variable {function_details} in the prompt so the python analyst knows the schema of the database
- There is no need for .replace since the fstring will replace the variables correctly
- Intermediate results must be printed so we can see what works and what doesn't

**Ideal Flow per task:**

1.  **OKR task:**
    -   Insights Behavioral Analyst: Finds directions for finding OKR since it has access to most visited urls and website heatmaps
    -   Python Analyst: Creates python blocks to query the data. Once reach code and okr code is found, send to OKR store group to create / store the OKR
    -   OKR store agent: Creates / formats an OKR, then stores it using the store_okr tool, it must format the input correctly.

2.  **Insight task:**
    -   Insights Behavioral Analyst: Finds directions for finding Insight since it has access to most visited urls and website heatmaps
    -   Python Analyst: Creates python blocks to query the data. Once insight code is found, send to Insight Analyst group to create / store the Insight
    -   Insight Analyst group / Insights Analyst: Creates / formats an Insight and stores it, it must format the input correctly.

3.  **Suggestion task:**
    -   Behavioral Analyst: Finds heatmaps and session recordings to find user behavior hypotheses based on insight
    -   UX Researcher: Finds UX research to back up hypotheses and find how to implement it
    -   Suggestions Analyst: Creates / formats a suggestion, then stores it using the store_suggestion tool, it must format the input correctly.

4.  **Design task:**
    -   Web Agent: Finds locations to implement the suggestion and find if it is already implemented. Once it finds evidence for either way, sends to the design group
    -   Design Agent: Creates a design for the suggestion and stores it using store_design, it must format the input correctly.

5.  **Code task:**
    -   Website Developer: Implements the design and sends to the Website Save group
    -   Website Get Save Agent: Stores the code using store_code, it must format the input correctly.

Notes for ideal flow:
-   The flow specified shows the ideal direction though it will likely have retries and back/forth between agents. 
-   The flow should be optimized to reduce the number of turns to get a successful output.
-   Each agent should execute the tools they have available and should not have an empty response. They should not wait for other agents responses or be triggered by another agent before executing their tools or be triggered. 
-   Rules should not prevent agents from outputting a response or using their tools. Agents should alway be encouraged to output a response and use their tools.

**Important Interaction Notes:**
- Only designated agents should use specific tools (especially store functions)
- The python_analyst is the only agent that can execute code and query databases
- Tool descriptions (ending with _tool_description) control how agents use available tools
- Evaluation questions (ending with _questions) validate outputs and prevent hallucinations - Do not update them, they are there for reference.
- IMPORTANT: If Agents output an empty message, a message saying they need more information, or a message that throws off the chat, that means something is wrong with the system prompt. Please check the prompt and make sure it is correct and remove rules that prevent it from outputting a response or triggering a tool.
- IMPORTANT: The Agent should never wait for the output of another agent to continue the conversation, they must execute the tools they have available regardless


Generate ONLY the new content for the prompt. Do not include any explanations or comments outside the prompt content. Do not prefix the prompt (eg by adding version numbers or suffix the prompt because the prompt will be provided as is to the LLM model. Do not add a ``` or ```python at the start of the prompt since the prompt should not be wrapped)


Role: system
Content: Your previous response had validation errors that need to be fixed. Focus specifically on addressing these errors:



IMPORTANT: Previous update attempts failed validation with these errors:

1. Error updating prompt: cannot access local variable 'traceback' where it is not associated with a value

Follow the instructions exactly and avoid introducing any explanations or comments. Output ONLY the corrected prompt content.

Role: user
Content: Please fix these validation errors in your response:



IMPORTANT: Previous update attempts failed validation with these errors:

1. Error updating prompt: cannot access local variable 'traceback' where it is not associated with a value

Make sure your response contains ONLY the corrected prompt content with no explanations or surrounding text.
