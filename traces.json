What are your main business objectives for the next 1-6 months?\n(Select all that apply):\"\t\"\n\nIncrease conversions, Improve user engagement, Engagement priorities: video views, scroll depth, clicks, map module engagement: https://rednavel.link/Gn7X7PTL \n\n2. What Objective Key Results (OKRs) are most important to you?\n(Select up to three):\"\t\"\n\nDecrease bounce rate, Enhance click-through rates (CTR), Form fills is by far #1...but when you say \"CTR\" I want to clarity that is on-site and not via Ads or SEO. How many click a button / viewed a section with that button...we've setup our Measurement this way via \"element visibility\" rules through GTM on the site and just wanted to clarity CTR means something different to us vs most. Viewing service pages and scroll + time on page (those together) are key. \n\n3. What tone or feeling do you want your website to convey?\n(Select all that apply):\"\t\n\nTrustworthy, Modern and sleek, Friendly and accessible\n\n4. Are there specific pages, sections, or features of your site you would like us to focus on improving?\t\n\nForm pages are key: https://redstagfulfillment.com/get-pricing/ https://redstagfulfillment.com/contact-us/ as are service pages: https://redstagfulfillment.com/order-fulfillment/ and the rest of where those are found. \n\nConversion priorities: form fills for both \"Let's Talk\" and \"Get Pricing\" which is the end of the funnel for this site. \n\n\n\n1. Who are your top competitors, and what differentiates your business from theirs?\t\"\n\nhttps://www.shipbob.com/ https://www.shipmonk.com/ https://www.efulfillmentservice.com/ https://www.shipfusion.com/ https://www.fulfillrite.com/\n\n2. Have you identified specific strengths or weaknesses in your competitors\u2019 websites or strategies? If so, what are they? \n(E.g., \u201cCompetitor X has excellent navigation, but their checkout flow is slow.\u201d)\"\t\"\n\n1. Competitive Positioning: Red Stag doesn't seem to focus on competing primarily on price. As mentioned in one meeting, \"we don't try to compete on price. Like we try to be competitive on price, but that's not where we're trying to win.\"  2. Unique Selling Points: Red Stag appears to differentiate itself in a few ways:    - Strategic Location: They have only two locations across the US, which is mentioned as a strategic choice for cheaper ground shipping prices.    - Fulfillment Services: They position themselves as \"#1 in ecommerce fulfillment services,\" though the specific reasons for this claim weren't detailed in the transcripts I found.  3. Value Propositions: There were discussions about highlighting Red Stag's unique value propositions, such as potentially saving customers money on shipping due to their strategic locations.  4. Sales Process: There was mention of Red Stag having an \"intense\" sales process, with a focus on determining whether they can save potential clients money on shipping within a 15-minute call.\n\n3. Are there any ongoing or upcoming marketing campaigns, industry trends, seasonal changes, or external factors we should consider when making recommendations? If so, what are they? \n(This could include holiday promotions, seasonal discounts, product launches, economic shifts, or emerging technologies.)\"\t\"\n\nThey are in the busy time of the year, as everyone is making sure they are fulfilling their 3PL needs from their holiday orders. \n\n4. Are there specific audiences critical to your business success? How are they defined?\n(E.g., \u201cTech-savvy millennials,\u201d \u201cValue-driven shoppers.\u201d)\"\t\"\n\nEcommerce business owners. Operations managers. \n\n1. What kind of suggestions are you most interested in?\n(Select all that apply):\"\t\"\n\n\nImproving navigation or site layout, Enhancing CTAs or user pathways, Optimizing underperforming pages or features, Personalizing user experiences (e.g., quizzes, recommendations), Increasing conversions or revenue.\n\n2. Are there any suggestions or changes you explicitly do NOT want to see?\n(E.g., \u201cNo popups\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t remove this feature.\u201d)\"\t\"\n\nNone\n\n3. What constraints should we keep in mind when making recommendations?\n(Monthly development budget, availability of development team, platform limitations, time constraints etc.):\"\t\n\nNone that comet to mind, but there is a limit on development every month (generally 2-3 tests). \n\n4.  Which tools and platforms do you have access to for site optimization across your entire stack? Please list all to eliminate infeasible suggestions.\n\nGA4, Microsoft Clarity, Hotjar for survey responses, they use Hubspot as well but we only have access to that through BigQuery. GAds and GSC I have access to as well...they have a healthy GAds budget every month, so any recommendations there would be what I'm looking for as well as those landing pages are a larger focus. \nThe domain is 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/'Please analyze this data and provide insights about user behavior and potential improvements:\nHere are the other OKRs stored, choose one as a base for the insight (use its okr_name when calling store_insight):\n[{\"markdown\": \"# OKR Analysis\\n\\n## Name\\nEnhance CTA Element Visibility on Heatmaps## Description\\nObjective: Improve daily click interactions on CTA elements by utilizing 'heatmaps' data, tracking click events for improved CTA visibility and grouping by session dates.## Last Updated\\n2025-02-16 01:49:30\\n\\n## Metrics\\n- Metric Name: cta_interactions\\n- Description: Daily count of CTA interaction events (clicks) derived from the 'heatmaps' table.

The reach fraction is \\u224830.32%, indicating that nearly one-third of total sessions engage with the CTA. Notably, the CTA element on the order fulfillment page at url 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/order-fulfillment' shows significantly lower engagement compared to our overall metrics, highlighting a potential design or placement flaw.\\n\\n## Problem Statement\\nThe CTA engagement is underperforming relative to the uplift target. With a current average of 176.29 interactions versus a goal of 220.36, and given that 208 unique sessions are recording CTA activity, there is a clear indication that the design or positioning of the CTA element on the order fulfillment page might be causing a tracking or engagement issue.\\n\\n## Business Objective\\nIncrease user engagement and conversion rates by optimizing the design and placement of key CTA elements, thereby raising the average CTA interactions and overall site performance.\\n\\n## Hypothesis\\nBy redesigning or repositioning the underperforming CTA element on the order fulfillment page, we expect to achieve the 25% uplift target \\u2013 increasing average interactions from 176.29 to 220.36 per day \\u2013 and enhance the reach fraction, ultimately improving user engagement metrics.\\n\\n## Metrics\\n- Frequency: 208\\n- Severity: 7\\n- Severity reasoning: The severity score is set at 7 because the CTA element on the order fulfillment page is underperforming despite 208 unique sessions showing engagement. With a current average of 176.29 interactions and a target of 220.36, the design anomaly poses a significant risk to conversion rates, suggesting that misalignment in design or placement could lead to substantial performance losses.\\n- Confidence: 0.85\\n- Confidence reasoning: We assign a confidence score of 0.85 based on robust data derivations. The metrics \\u2013 current average CTA interactions of 176.29, a target of 220.36 after applying a 25% uplift, and a reach fraction of 0.3032 \\u2013 are directly computed from detailed SQL queries executed over complete weekly data.

            "recommendations": "Below are some concrete recommendations for the Python Analyst to address the repeated storage errors:\n\n1.\u2003**Ensure All Required Fields Are Present and Correctly Typed:**  \n\u2003\u2022 The insight payload must include the following keys as dictated by the schema:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 data_statement (string, plain text)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 problem_statement (string, plain text)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 business_objective (string, plain text)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 hypothesis (string, plain text)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 frequency (numeric \u2013 for example, an integer or float, not a string like \"Daily\")  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 severity (numeric \u2013 for example, an integer such as 7; do not supply \u201cMedium\u201d)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 confidence (numeric \u2013 for instance, a float like 8.5; do not supply \u201cHigh\u201d)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 severity_reasoning (plain text)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 confidence_reasoning (plain text)  \n\n2.\u2003**Format the Derivations Field as a List of Dictionaries:**  \n\u2003\u2022 Each entry in the derivations list must have exactly these keys:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 variable_name (string)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 value (number, fixed literal)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 derivation (string, plain text explanation; do not include Python code that attempts to run calculations)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 description (string, plain text)  \n\u2003\u2022 For example, if you want to state that \u201ctarget_okr_value\u201d is computed as 0.143 \u00b7 1.25, then the entry should be:  \n\u2003\u2003{  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\"variable_name\": \"okr_target\",  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\"value\": 0.17875,  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\"derivation\": \"Calculated by multiplying 0.143 by 1.25 (i.e. 0.143 * 1.25 = 0.17875).\",  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\"description\": \"Target daily average interaction rate after applying a 25% uplift.\"  \n\u2003\u2003}\n\n3.\u2003**Fix the Variables Field Format:**  \n\u2003\u2022 The variables field must be a list (not a dictionary). Each variable dictionary must include:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 variable_name (string)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 value (number)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 readable (a human-readable string)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 tooltip (a short descriptive string)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 derivation (plain text explanation, not executable code)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 description (plain text)  \n\n4.\u2003**Remove Any Python Code From Narrative Fields:**  \n\u2003\u2022 The error messages indicate that the derivation text (for example, starting with \u201cComputed by dividing \u2026\u201d) is being interpreted as Python code \u2013 ensure that you supply purely plain text rather than code or dynamic tokens. Remove any leading code fragments (like \u201cimport pandas as pd\u2026\u201d) from the derivation key values.\n\n5.\u2003**Double Check String Escapes and Termination:**  \n\u2003\u2022 Verify that all strings are terminated correctly and that embedded quotes are properly escaped (or use triple quotes) so that no \u201cunterminated string literal\u201d errors occur.\n\n6.\u2003**Review Schema Documentation:**  \n\u2003\u2022 Look at the requirements (for example, from the pydantic error links) to ensure that all the fields (especially frequency, severity, confidence, derivations, and variables) are being passed with the correct data types.\n\n7.\u2003**Test With a Minimal Valid Payload:**  \n\u2003\u2022 Before adding additional details, try storing a minimal payload that includes all required keys with valid fixed literal values. For example, use numeric values for frequency, severity, and confidence, and supply short plain text for all derivation entries.\n\nBy following these specific recommendations, the Python Analyst can modify the payload so that all fields meet the expected schema\u2014the derivation and variables fields must be provided as plain text (without any attempt to execute code) and with all required keys (including \u201creadable\u201d and \u201ctooltip\u201d) present. Once these issues are fixed, the insight should store successfully.\n\nPlease make the corrections and then re-run the storage function.",
