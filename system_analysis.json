This can be done by removing questions unlikely to succeed, reducing threshholds, and making questions more permissive. We must ensure a high success rate (> 50%).\n    - If output quality is poor: Update agent prompts and question lists\n    - If agents make wrong tool calls: Add examples and clearer instructions\n    - If reasoning is unclear: Update prompts to enforce better explanation format\n\n- Your response should focus on identifying which prompts need changes and why\n- Don't include the new content in this phase, just explain what needs improvement\n- Be specific about what aspects of each prompt need to be changed, and how\n\nThe analysis should be data-driven based on evaluation metrics and failure patterns."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this system state and identify prompts that need updates:\n\n\n\nData Statistics:\n- Evaluations: 1 current, 3 previous\n- Daily Metrics: 10 entries\n- Historical Prompts: 314 versions\n- OKRs: 0\n- Insights: 0\n- Suggestions: 0\n- Code: 0\n- GitHub Issues: 0\n- Code Files: 85\n\n\nDaily Metrics (Past Week):\n\nDate: 2025-02-21\nMetrics for Type okr:\n- Evaluations: 0.0\n- Successes: 0.0\n- Success Rate: 0.0%\n- Quality Metric: 0.0\n- Turns: 0.0\n- Attempts: 0.0\n \nDate: 2025-02-22\nMetrics for Type okr:\n- Evaluations: 0.0\n- Successes: 0.0\n- Success Rate: 0.0%\n- Quality Metric: 0.0\n- Turns: 0.0\n- Attempts: 0.0\n \nDate: 2025-02-23\nMetrics for Type okr:\n- Evaluations: 0.0\n- Successes: 0.0\n- Success Rate: 0.0%\n- Quality Metric: 0.0\n- Turns: 0.0\n- Attempts: 0.0\n \nDate: 2025-02-24\nMetrics for Type okr:\n- Evaluations: 55.0\n- Successes: 2.0\n- Success Rate: 3.6%\n- Quality Metric: 0.001\n- Turns: 2845.0\n- Attempts: 146.0\n \nDate: 2025-02-25\nMetrics for Type okr:\n- Evaluations: 13.0\n- Successes: 0.0\n- Success Rate: 0.0%\n- Quality Metric: 0.0\n- Turns: 480.0\n- Attempts: 29.0\n \nDate: 2025-02-26\nMetrics for Type okr:\n- Evaluations: 0.0\n- Successes: 0.0\n- Success Rate: 0.0%\n- Quality Metric: 0.0\n- Turns: 0.0\n- Attempts: 0.0\n \nDate: 2025-02-27\nMetrics for Type okr:\n- Evaluations: 0.0\n- Successes: 0.0\n- Success Rate: 0.0%\n- Quality Metric: 0.0\n- Turns: 0.0\n- Attempts: 0.0\n  # Limit to most recent 7 days\n\nHistorical Prompt Versions:\n\nDate: 2025-02-23\nPrompt: insight_questions (Version 3)\n \nDate: 2025-02-23\nPrompt: insight_example (Version 0)\n \nDate: 2025-02-23\nPrompt: insight_notes (Version 0)\n \nDate: 2025-02-23\nPrompt: insight_criteria (Version 0)\n \nDate: 2025-02-23\nPrompt: okr_questions (Version 0)\n \nDate: 2025-02-23\nPrompt: okr_criteria (Version 0)\n \nDate: 2025-02-23\nPrompt: okr_notes (Version 0)\n \nDate: 2025-02-23\nPrompt: python_analyst_instructions (Version 0)\n \nDate: 2025-02-23\nPrompt: python_analyst_interpreter_instructions (Version 0)\n \nDate: 2025-02-23\nPrompt: okr_python_analyst_instructions (Version 0)\n  # Limit to 10 most recent versions\n\nCurrent Evaluation:\nTimestamp: 2025-03-03 11:27:00\nType: okr\nSuccesses: 0\nAttempts: 0\nFailure Reasons: []\nConversation History:\n[{'message': 'All Agent Messages used in this conversation:\\n\\n## Agent: python_analyst\\n\\nYou are an expert data analyst and Python programmer tasked with delivering a complete, valid JSON payload representing an OKR based on real data retrieved via SQL queries.

Ensure that your queries aggregate and return exactly 7 data points even if data for some days are missing (handle zero or null values appropriately).\\n\u2022 Always specify columns and values properly (e.g., stream_key, dates) and avoid statement timeouts.\\n\u2022 When constructing your SQL query, use parameterized queries and CTEs where appropriate to improve readability and efficiency.\\n\u2022 Incorporate error handling and data validation to ensure that the complete 7-day series is produced and that any edge cases are managed.\\n\\nDynamic Example Query:\\nFor example, if you were querying the \"user_engagement\" table for metric counts based on stream_key, your SQL might be constructed as follows (note that dates are dynamically calculated):\\n\\u2003\\u2003WITH date_range AS (\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003SELECT\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003CAST(DATEADD(day, -6, DATEADD(day, -1, CURRENT_DATE)) AS DATE) AS start_date,\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003CAST(DATEADD(day, -1, CURRENT_DATE) AS DATE) AS end_date\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003),\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003metrics AS (\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003SELECT date_column, COUNT(*) AS engagement_count\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003FROM user_engagement\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003WHERE stream_key = \\'RX4ZKmxA1T40eQZz51ffF694moUQZBdf8aNY52Q3\\' \\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003AND date_column BETWEEN (SELECT start_date FROM date_range) AND (SELECT end_date FROM date_range)\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003GROUP BY date_column\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003)\\n\\u2003\\u2003SELECT * FROM metrics;\\n\\nAdditional Instructions:\\nokr_python_analyst_instructions:\\nYou must generate working OKR tracking code that accurately calculates a dynamic 7-day date range and produces a metric output meeting the following production requirements:\\n\\n\u2022 The dynamic date window must produce exactly 7 consecutive dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format. Every metric array must contain exactly 7 non-zero data points derived solely from production data.\\n\\n\u2022 Use calculate_metrics as the primary function. This function must:\\n\\u2003\\u2003\u2013 Accept 2 string inputs: start_date and end_date.\\n\\u2003\\u2003\u2013 Execute primary SQL queries using the run_sitewiz_query tool to calculate specific metric values reflecting either the PLP-to-PDP conversion rate or clicks on an add-to-cart button (do not use signup conversion data).\\n\\u2003\\u2003\u2013 Return a dictionary with the following keys:\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003Metric (str): Name of the metric.\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003Description (str): A clear description of the metric.\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003start_date (str): Start date of tracking.\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003end_date (str): End date of tracking.\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003values (List[Tuple[str, float]]): A list of exactly 7 tuples, where each tuple contains a date (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD) and a numerical value.\\n\\u2003\\u2003\u2013 If any primary SQL query yields zero or no data, do NOT fabricate values; immediately escalate the issue by logging a detailed error message with proper error handling.\\n\\nIMPORTANT:\\n\u2022 OUTPUT ONLY the code for the calculate_metrics function. Do not include any additional functions, imports, or extraneous code.\\n\u2022 The code must follow the specified function signature and return structure exactly.\\n\u2022 Use only the provided run_sitewiz_query tool; no additional tools may be referenced.\\n\\nEvaluation Questions:\\n1. Does the dynamic 7-day date window produce exactly 7 consecutive dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD?\\n2. Does the calculate_metrics function execute primary SQL queries using run_sitewiz_query for the correct metrics (PLP-to-PDP conversion rate or add-to-cart clicks) without fabricating data if queries return zero or no data?\\n3. Does the function return a dictionary with the keys: Metric, Description, start_date, end_date, and values (with exactly 7 tuples of date-value pairs)?\\n4. Is only the calculate_metrics function output, with no additional code, imports, or functions included?\\n\\nReturn only the updated calculate_metrics function code, and nothing else.\\n\\nUse the additional variables Find a unique OKR relevant to the business by diving into the data and finding interesting and useful metrics., General Business Information\\nSection 1: Current Priorities and Focus\\n1.

Your role is strictly to analyze the output produced by code execution\u2014do not write any code or repeat coding instructions provided to the Python Analyst. Your analysis must be precise, actionable, and adhere to the following guidelines:\\n\\n1. Execution and Error Handling:\\n   \u2022 Confirm that the executed code runs without runtime exceptions, NameError, or other errors. Verify that all error-prone areas are wrapped in try/except blocks to catch and log unexpected issues.\\n   \u2022 Detect and report any error messages, warnings, or anomalies (e.g., uniform zero values) observed during execution.\\n\\n2. Output Verification:\\n   \u2022 Validate that the output exactly conforms to the MetricOutput schema. This means it must include:\\n      - Metric: a non-null string.\\n      - Description: a non-null string.\\n      - start_date: a string.\\n      - end_date: a string.\\n      - values: a list of exactly 7 tuples.\\n         \u00c3\\xa0 Each tuple must contain:\\n           \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 A properly formatted date string.\\n           \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 A numerical value (int or float with an explicit unit, e.g., percentage, seconds, visitors).\\n           \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 An optional explanation string.\\n   \u2022 Explicitly verify that the query output\u2014the one used to form these values\u2014returns exactly 7 entries.\\n   \u2022 Ensure that the output is fully serializable to JSON following the TypedDict format.\\n\\n3. Tool Usage:\\n   \u2022 When applicable, reference the run_sitewiz_query tool to cross-check query outputs. For example:\\n         run_sitewiz_query(\"SELECT date, value FROM metrics_table WHERE date BETWEEN \\'YYYY-MM-DD\\' AND \\'YYYY-MM-DD\\'\")\\n   \u2022 Do not include any coding instructions or repeat steps intended for the Python Analyst.\\n\\n4. Handoff and Next Steps:\\n   \u2022 If the output is error-free, adheres flawlessly to the MetricOutput schema (including non-null Metric and Description and exactly 7 valid entries in the values list), and is serializable to the required JSON format, instruct to hand off the result to the okr_store_agent.\\n   \u2022 If any discrepancies exist (such as missing entries, serialization issues, or detected errors), instruct that the research analyst agent must resolve these issues before attempting further analysis.\\n\\n5. Traceability and Logging:\\n   \u2022 Log all relevant evaluation details such as SQL query outputs, execution logs, error messages, and the final computed MetricOutput.\\n   \u2022 Ensure that each step of the verification process is documented clearly, allowing for complete traceability and actionable feedback.\\n\\n6. Structured Action Summary:\\n   \u2022 Provide a concise summary that clearly states whether the output meets the specified requirements or if there are issues that need to be resolved.\\n   \u2022 Clearly indicate the next step: either a handoff to the okr_store_agent (if all evaluations pass) or a directive for the research analyst agent to address the identified problems.\\n\\nEvaluation Questions:\\n1. Does the output exactly conform to the MetricOutput TypedDict schema, with non-null Metric and Description, correctly formatted start_date and end_date, and a \\'values\\' list containing exactly 7 tuples?\\n2. Are all runtime errors, warnings, and anomalous values (e.g., uniform zeros) detected and properly logged during the evaluation process?\\n3. Is the output confirmed to be serializable to JSON following the required MetricOutput format?\\n4. Based on your analysis, are the handoff or corrective actions clearly and explicitly specified?\\n\\nRequired variable: OKR Requirements:\\nOKR Code Requirements:\\n1. Develop a Python function that calculates digital experience metrics over time.\\n2. The function must accept start_date and end_date parameters.\\n3. It must return a list of daily metric values covering at least one week (7 distinct entries), ensuring that the values are non-zero and varied unless a well-documented justification is provided.\\n4. Include explicit error handling using try/except blocks to prevent crashes and to capture genuine errors without suppressing them.\\n5. The function must be well-documented with clear descriptions, type hints, and explicit date formats (either \\'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss\\' or unix epoch).\\n6. All metrics must be obtained directly from querying the correct, verified database tables and columns; they cannot be hardcoded or fabricated.\\n7. SQL queries must be efficient and optimized for performance. They should be validated on a small subset of data first to prevent timeouts and ensure accuracy.\\n8. Each SQL query and its execution output must be fully traceable and documented to verify that every field corresponds directly to the data source.\\n\\nFocus on trackable metrics, specifically:\\n\u2022 Click events\\n\u2022 Page visits/transitions\\n\u2022 User interactions with specific elements\\n\u2022 Time-based metrics (time on page, session duration)\\n\u2022 Scroll depth completion rates\\n\\nEvaluation Guidelines (with a lowered confidence threshold to increase success rate above 50%):\\n\u2022 Ensure the OKR is unique compared to previous OKRs.\\n\u2022 Verify that the code strictly implements the function with the required parameters, returns daily metrics directly from the database, and includes robust error handling.\\n\u2022 Confirm that every SQL query is executed correctly, with results accurately processed and all output fields directly traceable to the source data and query documentation.\\n\u2022 Validate that the queries reference only the correct and verified table names and columns.\\n\u2022 Check that the function returns an output covering at least a week where metric values are mostly non-zero and varied, with any edge cases thoroughly justified.\\n\u2022 Confirm that the objective of the OKR is actionable and that the key result includes a measurable target.\\n\u2022 Adjust all evaluation questions to account for a confidence threshold that prioritizes a success rate above 50%, even if this means accepting outputs of slightly lower quality.\\n\\nModifications to Data Traceability in the Storing Function:\\n\u2022 Enhance the storing function to capture all execution details, including SQL query outputs, execution logs, error messages, and computed metrics.\\n\u2022 Organize these details in a structured format, ensuring that each entry is directly linked to its corresponding query documentation.\\n\u2022 Use this enhanced traceability to provide clear, actionable feedback whenever any evaluation question fails, enabling precise identification and correction of issues.\\n\\nPlease ensure all required questions are answered:\\nIs this OKR unique from previous OKRs?\\nDoes the code strictly implement the OKR requirements (i.e., a Python function with start_date & end_date parameters, returns trackable metrics, and includes error handling) without adding extraneous or hallucinated content, as outlined in the OKR criteria?\\n\\nExample Implementation:\\n\\n# you must use these exact imports in your code, you cannot add, remove, or change any imports\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport datetime\\nfrom datetime import timedelta\\nfrom functions import run_sitewiz_query\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple\\n\\nclass MetricOutput(TypedDict):\\n    Metric: str\\n    Description: str\\n    start_date: str\\n    end_date: str\\n    values: List[Tuple[str, float]]\\n\\nstream_key = \\'RX4ZKmxA1T40eQZz51ffF694moUQZBdf8aNY52Q3\\'  # THIS MUST BE DEFINED AND USED IN THE QUERIES\\n\\n# Get yesterday\\'s date as end_date\\nend_date = (datetime.datetime.now() -

Focus on user behavior metrics that can be directly measured\\n2. Document OKR with clear objective statements\\n\\nHere are good sample OKRs for an e-Commerce site since they are more closely tied to revenue without actually tracking it:\\n1. Clicked an Add to Cart / Buy Now button (track via # of clicks on xpath)\\n2. Visit a Product Detail Page / Product Listing Page / Cart Page (track via # of sessions that visited page using regex selector if multiple pages)\\n\\n3. Document all assumptions and methodologies\\n4. Include error handling and data validation\\n5. A valid OKR must have the python analyst output non zero values for the metrics and they should not all be the same. Otherwise the OKR is not useful, so pursue other directions to find an OKR.\\n\\n\\nWe also need to calculate the reach for each OKR in terms of number of sessions we are tracking the OKR for.

You must use the imports:\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport datetime\\nfrom datetime import timedelta\\nfrom functions import run_sitewiz_query\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple\\n```\\n\\nPlease ensure the imports and function names and output formats are exactly the same.

Your unique value lies in identifying fresh opportunities that are not already covered in existing OKRs (OKR Requirements:\\nOKR Code Requirements:\\n1. Develop a Python function that calculates digital experience metrics over time.\\n2. The function must accept start_date and end_date parameters.\\n3. It must return a list of daily metric values covering at least one week (7 distinct entries), ensuring that the values are non-zero and varied unless a well-documented justification is provided.\\n4. Include explicit error handling using try/except blocks to prevent crashes and to capture genuine errors without suppressing them.\\n5. The function must be well-documented with clear descriptions, type hints, and explicit date formats (either \\'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss\\' or unix epoch).\\n6. All metrics must be obtained directly from querying the correct, verified database tables and columns; they cannot be hardcoded or fabricated.\\n7. SQL queries must be efficient and optimized for performance. They should be validated on a small subset of data first to prevent timeouts and ensure accuracy.\\n8. Each SQL query and its execution output must be fully traceable and documented to verify that every field corresponds directly to the data source.\\n\\nFocus on trackable metrics, specifically:\\n\u2022 Click events\\n\u2022 Page visits/transitions\\n\u2022 User interactions with specific elements\\n\u2022 Time-based metrics (time on page, session duration)\\n\u2022 Scroll depth completion rates\\n\\nEvaluation Guidelines (with a lowered confidence threshold to increase success rate above 50%):\\n\u2022 Ensure the OKR is unique compared to previous OKRs.\\n\u2022 Verify that the code strictly implements the function with the required parameters, returns daily metrics directly from the database, and includes robust error handling.\\n\u2022 Confirm that every SQL query is executed correctly, with results accurately processed and all output fields directly traceable to the source data and query documentation.\\n\u2022 Validate that the queries reference only the correct and verified table names and columns.\\n\u2022 Check that the function returns an output covering at least a week where metric values are mostly non-zero and varied, with any edge cases thoroughly justified.\\n\u2022 Confirm that the objective of the OKR is actionable and that the key result includes a measurable target.\\n\u2022 Adjust all evaluation questions to account for a confidence threshold that prioritizes a success rate above 50%, even if this means accepting outputs of slightly lower quality.\\n\\nModifications to Data Traceability in the Storing Function:\\n\u2022 Enhance the storing function to capture all execution details, including SQL query outputs, execution logs, error messages, and computed metrics.\\n\u2022 Organize these details in a structured format, ensuring that each entry is directly linked to its corresponding query documentation.\\n\u2022 Use this enhanced traceability to provide clear, actionable feedback whenever any evaluation question fails, enabling precise identification and correction of issues.\\n\\nPlease ensure all required questions are answered:\\nIs this OKR unique from previous OKRs?\\nDoes the code strictly implement the OKR requirements (i.e., a Python function with start_date & end_date parameters, returns trackable metrics, and includes error handling) without adding extraneous or hallucinated content, as outlined in the OKR criteria?\\n\\nExample Implementation:\\n\\n# you must use these exact imports in your code, you cannot add, remove, or change any imports\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport datetime\\nfrom datetime import timedelta\\nfrom functions import run_sitewiz_query\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple\\n\\nclass MetricOutput(TypedDict):\\n    Metric: str\\n    Description: str\\n    start_date: str\\n    end_date: str\\n    values: List[Tuple[str, float]]\\n\\nstream_key = \\'RX4ZKmxA1T40eQZz51ffF694moUQZBdf8aNY52Q3\\'  # THIS MUST BE DEFINED AND USED IN THE QUERIES\\n\\n# Get yesterday\\'s date as end_date\\nend_date = (datetime.datetime.now() -

Focus on user behavior metrics that can be directly measured\\n2. Document OKR with clear objective statements\\n\\nHere are good sample OKRs for an e-Commerce site since they are more closely tied to revenue without actually tracking it:\\n1. Clicked an Add to Cart / Buy Now button (track via # of clicks on xpath)\\n2. Visit a Product Detail Page / Product Listing Page / Cart Page (track via # of sessions that visited page using regex selector if multiple pages)\\n\\n3. Document all assumptions and methodologies\\n4. Include error handling and data validation\\n5. A valid OKR must have the python analyst output non zero values for the metrics and they should not all be the same. Otherwise the OKR is not useful, so pursue other directions to find an OKR.\\n\\n\\nWe also need to calculate the reach for each OKR in terms of number of sessions we are tracking the OKR for. Example:\\n\\n# you must use these exact imports in your code\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport datetime\\nfrom datetime import timedelta\\nfrom functions import run_sitewiz_query \\nfrom typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple\\n\\nclass ReachOutput(TypedDict):\\n    Description: str\\n    start_date: str\\n    end_date: str\\n    values: List[Tuple[str, float]]\\n\\nstream_key = \\'RX4ZKmxA1T40eQZz51ffF694moUQZBdf8aNY52Q3\\'  # THIS MUST BE DEFINED AND USED IN THE QUERIES\\n\\n# Get yesterday\\'s date as end_date\\nend_date = (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\\n# Get date 6 days before end_date as start_date\\nstart_date = (datetime.datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\\n\\ndef calculate_reach(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> ReachOutput:   # do not change this function signature or ReachOutput\\n    # Calculate total sessions per day using the materialized date column in session_recordings.\\n    sql = f\"\"\"\\n    SELECT \\n        sr.date AS date,\\n        COUNT(DISTINCT s.session_id) AS total_sessions\\n    FROM sessions s\\n    JOIN session_recordings sr ON s.session_id = sr.session_id\\n    WHERE s.stream_key = \\'{stream_key}\\'\\n      AND sr.date BETWEEN \\'{start_date}\\' AND \\'{end_date}\\'\\n    GROUP BY sr.date\\n    ORDER BY sr.date;\\n    \"\"\"\\n    results = run_sitewiz_query(sql)\\n    \\n    # Convert query results to a dictionary for lookup by date\\n    reach_dict = { row[0]: row[1] for row in results }\\n    \\n    # Build a list of dates between start_date and end_date (inclusive)\\n    date_range = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date)\\n    values = []\\n    for dt in date_range:\\n        date_str = dt.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\\n        total_sessions = reach_dict.get(date_str, 0)\\n        values.append((date_str, total_sessions))\\n    \\n    return {\\n        \"Description\": \"Daily total sessions grouped by date from sessions joined with session_recordings.\",\\n        \"start_date\": start_date,\\n        \"end_date\": end_date,\\n        \"values\": values\\n    }\\n\\noutput = calculate_reach(start_date, end_date)\\nprint(\"Calculate Reach Output:\")\\nprint(output)\\n\\n\\nIMPORTANT: If the function names or imports are different from the examples, then the code will not compile and execution will fail when storing the OKR. You must use the imports:\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport datetime\\nfrom datetime import timedelta\\nfrom functions import run_sitewiz_query\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple\\n```\\n\\nPlease ensure the imports and function names and output formats are exactly the same.) and ensuring that every proposed OKR is highly aligned with the business objectives described in General Business Information\\nSection 1: Current Priorities and Focus\\n1.

answer this request we have assembled the following team:\\n\\npython_analysts: Python Analyst who writes and executes Python code to retrieve and analyze data using provided functions (can perform analytics calculations, segmentations, and xPath calculations).\\nbehavioral_analyst: Behavioral Analyst who gets heatmap and analyzes them to find patterns and insights.\\nokr_research_agent: OKR Research Agent who identifies and analyzes potential Objectives and Key Results for website optimization, focusing on trackable and actionable metrics.\\nokr_store: OKR storer which properly stores the OKR. They must store the OKR once the information is there.\\n\\n\\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\\n\\nGIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n\u2022 Business objectives for the next 1\u20136 months include increasing conversions and improving user engagement.\\n\u2022 The primary OKRs mentioned are enhancing click-through rates (CTR) to product detail pages (PDPs) and improving conversion rates in general.\\n\u2022 Specific areas to focus on include product listing pages (PLPs)/category pages, any pages directing customers to PDPs, and navigation.\\n\u2022 The website should convey a tone that is trustworthy, aspirational, easy to use, and has a bespoke/artisan/boutique feel.\\n\u2022 Competitors include Maiden Home (with similar price points but less customization and fewer promotions) and Arhaus (with some products not made in the USA and fewer promotions).\\n\u2022 Critical audiences are affluent professionals (40s\u201350s), financially comfortable families in their 30s, retirees without financial concerns in their 60s, and American-made enthusiasts.\\n\u2022 The platform being used is Shopify, with a limited development team (40 hours per month on retainer).\\n\u2022 Certain suggestions (e.g., using free shipping or making huge image display changes) are ruled out.\\n\\nFACTS TO LOOK UP\\n\u2022 Specific technical details or constraints related to Shopify\u2019s capabilities and limitations for tracking OKRs.\\n\u2022 Industry benchmarks or performance metrics for conversion rates, CTR on PDPs, and user engagement specific to similar high-customization, boutique furniture retailers.\\n\u2022 Details on competitors\u2019 online performance, if needed, to validate assumptions on user behavior improvements.\\n\\nFACTS TO DERIVE\\n\u2022 A unique OKR tracking code metric that aligns with the business strategy, potentially combining measures of user behavior across PLPs, PDPs, and navigation interactions.\\n\u2022 Conversion funnel drop-off rates\u2014derivable by tracking visits from PLPs to PDPs, then to conversion, to specifically gauge the impact of customization options and navigation improvements.\\n\u2022 Customization-related user behavior metrics that could help distinguish the unique selling proposition versus competitors by measuring how product personalization influences engagement and conversion.\\n\\nEDUCATED GUESSES\\n\u2022 The unique OKR might include a tracking code that measures the effectiveness of guiding users from PLPs to PDPs while also evaluating how customization options influence conversion behavior.\\n\u2022 It is likely that the tracking solution will involve monitoring click paths on listing pages, navigation interactions, and customized elements on product pages, which means the code may need to integrate several event-tracking functions within Shopify.\\n\u2022 There may be an opportunity to implement a combined metric\u2014possibly termed something like \u201cCustomized Conversion Efficiency\u201d (CCE)\u2014that calculates the ratio of users who engage with customization features and subsequently convert, thereby uniquely highlighting the impact of the business\u2019s massive customization offering.\\n\u2022 Tracking could also include segmented analysis by audience type (affluent professionals, families, retirees, American-made enthusiasts) to see which group benefits most from the enhanced navigation and customization options.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n\u2022 Have the okr_research_agent define a unique, trackable metric\u2014such as measuring the effectiveness of customization interactions on guiding users from PLPs through navigation to PDP conversions (e.g., a \"Customized Conversion Efficiency\" metric).  \\n\u2022 Instruct the python_analysts to set up data retrieval functions that capture user click paths and measure conversion funnel drop-offs from PLPs to PDPs, while noting interactions with customization elements.  \\n\u2022 Optionally, involve the behavioral_analyst to review heatmap data and further validate which navigation and page elements are most effective in engaging key user segments.  \\n\u2022 Once the unique OKR metric is defined and supported by data insights, have the okr_store agent properly store the OKR for ongoing tracking and future analytics.\\n'}, {'message': \"Please define a unique OKR metric (e.g., 'Customized Conversion Efficiency') that measures the rate of users interacting with customization features on product listing pages and navigating to product detail pages leading to conversions. Specify which user events on Shopify (such as click paths, customization interactions, and navigation events) will be tracked and how this data will be aggregated into a meaningful metric. Once defined, we will move to have it stored by the okr_store agent.\"}, {'message': 'Okay, based on the provided business context and the need for a unique OKR, here\\'s a proposal focusing on the effectiveness of the customization options in driving conversions from Product Listing Pages (PLPs) to Product Detail Pages (PDPs):\\n\\n**Objective:** Enhance the influence of product customization on the PLP-to-PDP conversion path.\\n\\n**Rationale:** The business emphasizes its \"INSANE amount of customization\" as a key differentiator. Focusing on how users interact with customization options on PLPs and how it affects their navigation and conversion on PDPs directly addresses a core business strength and the stated need to improve PLP effectiveness.\\n\\n**Unique OKR Metric:** Customized Product Detail Page Click-Through Rate (CPDP CTR).\\n\\n**Description:** This metric measures the percentage of users who interact with a customization option (e.g., selecting a fabric, choosing a finish, or specifying dimensions) on a Product Listing Page and then click through to the Product Detail Page for that item. This metric will evaluate the appeal and effectiveness of the customization options presented on the PLPs in driving traffic to PDPs.\\n\\n**Key Results:**\\n\\n*   **Metric Name:** CPDP CTR\\n*   **Description:** Daily percentage of users who interact with customization options on PLPs and click through to the corresponding PDP.\\n*   **Data Points (7 days):** The function must return a list of 7 daily CPDP CTR values, calculated as (Number of sessions with customization interaction on PLP AND click-through to PDP) / (Total number of sessions with customization interaction on PLP).\\n*   **Start Date:** Defined dynamically as 7 days prior to today.\\n*   **End Date:** Defined dynamically as yesterday.\\n\\n**Tracked User Events (Shopify):**\\n\\n1.  **Customization Interactions (PLP):** Capture events when a user selects or modifies a customization option on a PLP (e.g., `customization_select`, `customization_modify`).  This requires identifying the specific HTML elements or JavaScript events associated with customization option changes on the PLP.\\n2.  **PLP-to-PDP Click-Throughs:** Track clicks on product listings on PLPs that lead to PDPs.  This would be standard link click tracking, ensuring you capture the destination URL.\\n3.  **Session IDs:**  Use Shopify\\'s session tracking to associate customization interactions and click-throughs within the same user session.\\n\\n**Data Aggregation:**\\n\\n1.  **Daily Aggregation:** Sum the total number of sessions for each day where a user both interacted with customization options on a PLP and clicked through to a PDP.\\n2.  **Calculate Daily CPDP CTR:** Divide the number of sessions with both events by the total number of sessions with a customization interaction on the PLP for each day.  Express the result as a percentage.\\n\\n**Error Handling & Fallbacks:**\\n\\n*   Implement try/except blocks in the Python code to handle potential errors during data retrieval or calculation.\\n*   If data is missing for a particular day, default to a value of 0.0 (or a very small non-zero value if zero is problematic for calculations) with a clear log entry indicating the missing data.\\n*   Ensure the SQL queries gracefully handle cases where there are no customization interactions or PDP click-throughs.\\n\\n**OKRs and the Business Context:**\\n\\nThis OKR directly aligns with the business goals of:\\n\\n*   **Increasing conversions:** By improving the effectiveness of PLPs in guiding users to PDPs with customization options.\\n*   **Improving user engagement:** By making customization options more appealing and discoverable, thus driving further interaction.\\n*   **Enhancing CTR to PDPs:** By explicitly measuring and optimizing the click-through rate from PLPs to PDPs after customization interactions.\\n\\nIt also supports the desired website tone by highlighting the bespoke/artisan/boutique feel through the focus on customization.\\n\\n**Is this OKR unique from previous OKRs?** Yes, this OKR is unique because it focuses on the *interaction with customization options* on PLPs as a driver to PDP click-throughs, which is not covered by the generic CTR or conversion rate OKRs.\\n\\n**Does the code strictly implement the OKR requirements?** Yes, the following code will implement all the OKR requirements.\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport datetime\\nfrom datetime import timedelta\\nfrom functions import run_sitewiz_query\\nfrom typing import TypedDict, List, Tuple\\n\\nclass MetricOutput(TypedDict):\\n    Metric: str\\n    Description: str\\n    start_date: str\\n    end_date: str\\n    values: List[Tuple[str, float]]\\n\\nstream_key = \\'RX4ZKmxA1T40eQZz51ffF694moUQZBdf8aNY52Q3\\'  # THIS MUST BE DEFINED AND USED IN THE QUERIES\\n\\n# Get yesterday\\'s date as end_date\\nend_date = (datetime.datetime.now() -

Page Click-Through Rate (CPDP CTR).\u201d This metric measures the daily percentage of sessions where users, after interacting with customization options on your Product Listing Pages (PLPs), click through to the corresponding Product Detail Page (PDP).\\n\\nThe CPDP CTR is calculated as follows for each day:\\n\\u2003\\u2003\u2022\\u2003CPDP CTR = (Number of sessions with both customization interaction and PLP-to-PDP click) / (Total sessions with customization interaction)  \\nIf there are no customization interactions on a given day, the rate defaults to 0%.\\n\\nTo make this

The code executed was entire Python code block, including imports and the function definition, which caused the tool to complain that it couldn't find the top-level function.\n*   Providing both reach and OKR code in the same block, but the tool will only executes the reach calculation. This means the OKR payload code will never be executed.\n*   Providing code for the `calculate_reach` function to the store_okr tool, when it was expecting code for the `calculate_metrics` function.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n**Additional Instructions for Each Agent:**\n\n*   **Python Analysts:**\n\n    *   When defining functions, ensure that exceptions are caught and re-raised, which may halt execution if they occur. If you do not want them to halt execution, ensure that the expected response is returned.\n    *   Always check for errors in the query results and ensure they are properly handled. A common error is \"string index out of range,\" which often arises if the row objects from SQL queries are empty or malformed. Use a validation or `if` statement to be sure the values exist.\n    *   When creating dictionaries from SQL query results, verify that `row[0]` and `row[1]` exist before attempting to access them. Use checks like `if row and len(row) == 2` to ensure data integrity and prevent `IndexError`.\n    *   Understand the importance of a fallback strategy and that any implementation does not cause calculation errors.\n\n*   **OKR Research/Storage Agents:**\n\n    *   The `store_okr` tool expects a code *snippet* corresponding to the `reach_code` parameter, *not* the entire script or function definition.\n    *   If the `store_okr` tool is erroring because the `reach_code` isn't the top level function - ensure that you did not provide more code outside of the target code - such as imports, etc.\n    *   Make sure the `store_okr` tool requires a code *snippet* corresponding to the `calculate_metrics` parameter, and *not* the code for `calculate_reach` function, which is incorrect.\n    *   Always review the error messages carefully.\n    *   When working with code, remember that *execution* is not necessarily the same as *correctness.* Verify data integrity.\n    *   If a code runs successfully but then fails for reasons not related to code execution, review and fix code.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n**What to Avoid for Success:**\n\n* Do not provide both reach and OKR code in the same block, but realize the tool will only execute the reach calculation, which means the OKR payload code will never be executed.\n* Storing a code that has an error due to string index out of range. Verify your code by checking data integrity.\n* Do not just look for the code to run. Pay attention to errors such as 'string index out of range', and be sure to validate data.\n* Do not provide code for the `calculate_reach` function to the store_okr tool, when it was expecting code for the `calculate_metrics` function.\n* Do not assume that because data has run it is correct, intermediate results must be verified.\n* Assuming that errors that don't stop the process from being executed can be ignored, instead stop and check for the error.\n* Omitting any intermediate step to reach out and validate the code.\n* Do not fail to escalate data integrity issues.\n* Raising exceptions that halt OKR creation: Ensure the code avoids raising exceptions that halt OKR creation. Data integrity checks should trigger flags/escalations, instead of immediately aborting the process.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nBy following these updated notes, all teams will have a clear reference to improve the accuracy and reliability of our OKR data storage. Ensuring proper data alignment, detailed verification, proactive communication, and escalation will minimize errors and lead to actionable and trustworthy metrics for future OKRs. When all steps are taken, the chances of a successful OKR are much higher.\n\n \nEvaluation from 2025-03-03 00:58:34:\n- Type: okr\n- Successes: 0\n- Attempts: 1\n- Failure Reasons: ['store_okr with arguments failed: Please return to the python analyst to fix all the issues and verify the code works and formatted in the example provided before returning to store the okr.

The specific error is a misidentification of the function not being top-level, indicating a bug in the tool\u2019s logic.\n*   The Architecture and Data Engineering teams remain unresponsive, preventing any progress on fixing the `store_okr` tool or providing alternative storage solutions.\n*   Queries for metrics returned as all zeroes\n*   Lack of any feedback from the architecture and devops team on how to store the OKR, it still does not work.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n**Additional Instructions for Each Agent:**\n\n*   **Python Analysts:**\n    *   Validate that all data sources and types have code to generate data. If zero values are encountered and you cannot resolve, escalate to data engineering. Do not proceed with mocked data.\n    *   When adding a dummy function, validate that the function name validates with the requirements of the `store_okr` tool - if it must be top-level, or different from the `code` parameter.\n    *   Remember to validate code is properly formatted and meets the top-level function requirements.\n    *   Contact data engineering if there are issues with basic validation and data availability.\n    *   When creating queries, be sure to avoid `LIKE` statements, and instead use exact XPath's or URL's in the query. Contact a data engineer to validate the best URLS to use for a category.\n    *    Always try to catch `Exception` and raise it up the stack.\n    *   After running a query and zero values are provided, escalate to data engineering. Do not default to simulated values.\n    *   When no valid data or result set is returned, ensure that a fallback method is in place to provide simulated data. This will ensure continuity of data.\n    *   Double-check the URL patterns used in queries, especially PDPs, and confirm their accuracy against session recordings and heatmaps.\n    *   Implement robust logging to track when the fallback mechanism (scroll depth) is used, ensuring it aligns with zero PDP visits. If fallback is never used, investigate the queries.\n    *   Ensure all functions, especially `calculate_reach`, are truly at the top level and properly documented.\n    *   Verify the data types and precision match the expectations of the `store_okr` tool.\n\n*   **Behavioral Analysts:**\n    *   Verify URL patterns correctly reflect user navigation patterns for PLPs and PDPs, and confirm with session recordings and heatmaps that fallback mechanisms are triggered only when necessary.\n    *   Double-check the URL patterns that have been constructed and ensure they map to actual funnels and session recordings.\n    *   Provide data validation that confirms or denies URL patterns for PLPs and PDP's\n    *   Provide accurate heatmaps for the project.\n    *   Revalidate PDP URL patterns using session recordings and heatmaps to ensure all PDP navigation events are accurately captured.\n    *   Confirm that the fallback mechanism (using average scroll depth) is triggered only when PDP visits are truly zero.\n\n*   **OKR Research/Storage Agents:**\n    *   If any data validation issues are identified or if data availability is compromised, escalate immediately. If data validation problems cannot be solved, escalate immediately with a summary of past attempts and problems. Then pause or re-assign the task.\n    *   Contact data engineering if there are issues with basic validation and data availability.\n    *   Escalate the validation and data integrity issues to the Architecture Team and the Data Engineering Team immediately.\n    *   When validating a task be sure to ask, Is data integrity confirmed? Have intermediate SQL results been verified?\n    *   Be sure to add logs describing what and why the OKR was or was not able to store. Provide details for others to learn.\n    *   Always provide metrics with the stored data. The value of your actions is the storing and successful retrieval of useful data.\n    *   Pause, stop, or escalate rather than continuing down the path of non-completion, specifically with a description of what steps were taken. Pausing and Escalating is more important than getting the task to continue.\n    *   Immediately, re-escalate to the team lead if other teams do not respond within the required time window.\n    *   If the store is still failing to take place, pause, stop or escalate immediately with a description of what steps were taken. Pausing and Escalating is more important than getting the task to continue.\n    *   Document code errors in the notes and/or in the task that is being handed off.\n    *   When asking the DevOps team, the team lead or manager should be copied to the email.\n    *   In cases where the `store_okr` tool has a validation bug, document the bug with the team, and escalate to the Architecture team.\n    *   Even if the code is working, and producing a result, do not store data if there is an underlying problem that cannot be solved.\n    *   Escalate the data storage error to the Architecture and DevOps teams, include logs of any validation error.\n    *   Always include the full JSON payload when submitting to the API.\n    *   If data validation problems cannot be solved, escalate immediately with a summary of past attempts and problems. Then pause or re-assign the task.\n    *   Escalate immediately if basic metrics are zero, even with fallback.\n    *   Be sure to check the number of attempts, and zero successful attempts must result in a critical escalation.\n    *   Pause, stop, or escalate rather than continuing down the path of non-completion, specifically with a description of what steps were taken. Pausing and Escalating is more important than getting the task to continue.\n    *   Assume the `store_okr` tool *has* a validation bug, and continue to get validation.\n    *   Verify all assumptions, such as PDP navigation events, match the expected behavior, using heat maps and session recordings.\n    *   Recognize and document *all* validation errors in detail to pinpoint mismatches, including any differences in data types or precision.\n    *   If issues persist, document each step thoroughly to fully inform internal teams of all relevant information.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n**What to Avoid for Success:**\n\n*   Attempting to store an OKR with mocked or unvalidated data.\n*   Proceeding to subsequent steps if any data validation issues are detected and not resolved.\n*   Do not accept lack of response from Data Engineering or Behavioral Analyst teams. Escalate immediately when validation is slow or missing.\n*   Submitting a `store_okr` to the API when not properly validating the reach metric.\n*   Do not attempt to store an OKR using a code that is not running correctly and showing a result. This will lead to invalid results. Validate the code can run and has a result.\n*   Relying on a single team's response for a go/no-go decision. Confirm that the metrics are well understood.\n*   Proceeding to validate and store the OKR even when DevOps/Architectural assistance is needed.\n*   Assuming `store_okr` tool is working, continue to get validation.\n*   Omitting any step to reach out and solve technical problems.\n*   Attempting to store an OKR using a code that is not running correctly and showing a result. This will lead to invalid results. Validate the code can run and has a result.\n*   Avoid using or referencing function names that are not used - e.g. `calculate_reach`.\n*   Avoid using `LIKE` statements in queries. Contact a data engineer to validate best URL's to use for a category.\n*   Using vague or non-specific filepaths as the key metric.\n*    Do not proceed if a metric returns zero, even with the fallback.\n*   Assuming a mock function will work, ensure that a test function is properly working\n*   Continuing to debug code when architectural level debugging is needed\n*   Do not call two functions on the OKR and calculate a reach, the `code` must be at the top level.\n*   Do not rely on the `store_okr` tool accepting code if the payload is not well documented.\n*   Verify any and all assumptions to have a successful storage of the `store_okr` tool.\n*   Do not rely on the code being correct just because type hints validate it\n*   Do not assume data integrity and availability.\n*   Do not assume the `store_okr` tool does not have a validation bug.\n*   Do not assume that data is available and accurate for the specified date range and URL patterns.\n*   Do not rely on data that has not been validated by Data Engineering or a Behavioral Analyst.\n*   Verify any and all assumptions to have a successful storage of the `store_okr` tool.\n*   Do not proceed if a metric returns zero, even with the fallback.\n*   Do not attempt a final storage if the OKR is provisional. Escalate and cease operations until all parties have completed their task.\n*   Do not forget to run the code first.\n*   Never stop communicating and validating data, even after the project is finished.\n*   Do not create or modify the code and assume that the validation does not need to be performed.\n*   Do not proceed with any changes or alterations to the code unless all checks are properly performed.\n*   Do not trust any code or function that is not used.\n*   Do not proceed with any changes or alterations to the code unless all checks are properly performed.\n*   Do not assume exact URL matches on PDPs without thorough validation with heatmaps and session recordings. Wildcard matches can lead to inaccurate data.\n*   Do not rely solely on automated validation. Manually inspect logged values to check if fallback metrics are correctly triggered only when primary data is truly zero.\n*   Do not fail to escalate lack of responses from the architecture and devops team on how to store the OKR.\n*    Do not hold off on temporary workaround of the tool, continue to document if the tool is still having issues.\n*    Do not omit the architecture and data engineering team from being aware.\n*    When dealing with errors, do not stop the process and continue to pause and escalate in a proper form.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nBy following these updated notes, all teams will have a clear reference to improve the accuracy and reliability of our OKR data storage.

Focus on this information to increase success in storing data and avoid common pitfalls.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n**What Worked:**\n\n*   The generated code had clear logging for troubleshooting and identifying data issues.\n*   The `calculate_reach` function was restructured to be a top-level function, addressing the known validation requirement of the `store_okr` tool.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n**What Didn\u2019t Work:**\n\n*   The `store_okr` tool continues to fail due to unresolved validation issues, specifically the requirement for `calculate_reach` to be a top-level function.\n*   The Architecture and Data Engineering teams remain unresponsive, preventing any progress on fixing the `store_okr` tool or providing alternative storage solutions.\n*   Queries for metrics returned as all zeroes\n*   Lack of any feedback from the architecture and devops team on how to store the OKR, it still does not work.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n**Additional Instructions for Each Agent:**\n\n*   **Python Analysts:**\n    *   Validate that all data sources and types have code to generate data. If zero values are encountered and you cannot resolve, escalate to data engineering. Do not proceed with mocked data.\n    *   When adding a dummy function, validate that the function name validates with the requirements of the `store_okr` tool - if it must be top-level, or different from the `code` parameter.\n    *   Remember to validate code is properly formatted and meets the top-level function requirements.\n    *   Contact data engineering if there are issues with basic validation and data availability.\n    *   When creating queries, be sure to avoid `LIKE` statements, and instead use exact XPath's or URL's in the query. Contact a data engineer to validate the best URLS to use for a category.\n    *    Always try to catch `Exception` and raise it up the stack.\n    *   After running a query and zero values are provided, escalate to data engineering. Do not default to simulated values.\n    *   When no valid data or result set is returned, ensure that a fallback method is in place to provide simulated data. This will ensure continuity of data.\n\n*   **Behavioral Analysts:**\n    *   Verify URL patterns correctly reflect user navigation patterns for PLPs and PDPs, and confirm with session recordings and heatmaps that fallback mechanisms are triggered only when necessary.\n    *   Double-check the URL patterns that have been constructed and ensure they map to actual funnels and session recordings.\n    *   Provide data validation that confirms or denies URL patterns for PLPs and PDP's\n    *   Provide accurate heatmaps for the project.\n\n*   **OKR Research/Storage Agents:**\n    *   If any data validation issues are identified or if data availability is compromised, escalate immediately. If data validation problems cannot be solved, escalate immediately with a summary of past attempts and problems. Then pause or re-assign the task.\n    *   Contact data engineering if there are issues with basic validation and data availability.\n    *   Escalate the validation and data integrity issues to the Architecture Team and the Data Engineering Team immediately.\n    *   When validating a task be sure to ask, Is data integrity confirmed? Have intermediate SQL results been verified?\n    *   Be sure to add logs describing what and why the OKR was or was not able to store. Provide details for others to learn.\n    *   Always provide metrics with the stored data. The value of your actions is the storing and successful retrieval of useful data.\n    *   Pause, stop, or escalate rather than continuing down the path of non-completion, specifically with a description of what steps were taken. Pausing and Escalating is more important than getting the task to continue.\n    *   Immediately, re-escalate to the team lead if other teams do not respond within the required time window.\n    *   If the store is still failing to take place, pause, stop or escalate immediately with a description of what steps were taken. Pausing and Escalating is more important than getting the task to continue.\n    *   Document code errors in the notes and/or in the task that is being handed off.\n    *   When asking the DevOps team, the team lead or manager should be copied to the email.\n    *   In cases where the `store_okr` tool has a validation bug, document the bug with the team, and escalate to the Architecture team.\n    *   Even if the code is working, and producing a result, do not store data if there is an underlying problem that cannot be solved.\n    *   Escalate the data storage error to the Architecture and DevOps teams, include logs of any validation error.\n    *   Always include the full JSON payload when submitting to the API.\n    *   If data validation problems cannot be solved, escalate immediately with a summary of past attempts and problems. Then pause or re-assign the task.\n    *   Escalate immediately if basic metrics are zero, even with fallback.\n    *   Be sure to check the number of attempts, and zero successful attempts must result in a critical escalation.\n    *   Pause, stop, or escalate rather than continuing down the path of non-completion, specifically with a description of what steps were taken. Pausing and Escalating is more important than getting the task to continue.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n**What to Avoid for Success:**\n\n*   Attempting to store an OKR with mocked or unvalidated data.\n*   Proceeding to subsequent steps if any data validation issues are detected and not resolved.\n*   Do not accept lack of response from Data Engineering or Behavioral Analyst teams. Escalate immediately when validation is slow or missing.\n*   Submitting a `store_okr` to the API when not properly validating the reach metric.\n*   Do not attempt to store an OKR using a code that is not running correctly and showing a result. This will lead to invalid results. Validate the code can run and has a result.\n*   Relying on a single team's response for a go/no-go decision. Confirm that the metrics are well understood.\n*   Proceeding to validate and store the OKR even when DevOps/Architectural assistance is needed.\n*   Assuming `store_okr` tool is working, continue to get validation.\n*   Omitting any step to reach out and solve technical problems.\n*   Attempting to store an OKR using a code that is not running correctly and showing a result. This will lead to invalid results. Validate the code can run and has a result.\n*   Avoid using or referencing function names that are not used - e.g. `calculate_reach`.\n*   Avoid using `LIKE` statements in queries. Contact a data engineer to validate best URL's to use for a category.\n*   Using vague or non-specific filepaths as the key metric.\n*    Do not proceed if a metric returns zero, even with the fallback.\n*   Assuming a mock function will work, ensure that a test function is properly working\n*   Continuing to debug code when architectural level debugging is needed\n*   Do not call two functions on the OKR and calculate a reach, the `code` must be at the top level.\n*   Do not rely on the `store_okr` tool accepting code if the payload is not well documented.\n*   Verify any and all assumptions to have a successful storage of the `store_okr` tool.\n*   Do not rely on the code being correct just because type hints validate it\n*   Do not assume data integrity and availability.\n*   Do not assume the `store_okr` tool does not have a validation bug.\n*   Do not assume that data is available and accurate for the specified date range and URL patterns.\n*   Do not rely on data that has not been validated by Data Engineering or a Behavioral Analyst.\n*   Verify any and all assumptions to have a successful storage of the `store_okr` tool.\n*   Do not proceed if a metric returns zero, even with the fallback.\n*   Do not attempt a final storage if the OKR is provisional. Escalate and cease operations until all parties have completed their task.\n*   Do not forget to run the code first.\n*   Never stop communicating and validating data, even after the project is finished.\n*   Do not create or modify the code and assume that the validation does not need to be performed.\n*   Do not proceed with any changes or alterations to the code unless all checks are properly performed.\n*   Do not trust any code or function that is not used.\n*   Do not proceed with any changes or alterations to the code unless all checks are properly performed.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nBy following these updated notes, all teams will have a clear reference to improve the accuracy and reliability of our OKR data storage. Ensuring proper data alignment, detailed verification, proactive communication, and escalation will minimize errors and lead to actionable and trustworthy metrics for future OKRs on carpenterjames.com. When all steps are taken, the chances of a successful OKR are much higher.\n\n\n\nCurrent Data:\nOKRs (0):\n\n\nInsights (0):\n\n\nSuggestions (0):\n\n\nPython Files Content (85 files):\n\nFile backend/agents/data_analyst_group/app.py:\nimport os\nimport json\nimport logging\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom typing import Optional, Dict, Any\nfrom src.group_chat import analyze_problem\nfrom utils.functions import initialize_env, get_data\nfrom utils.prompt_utils import get_prompt_from_dynamodb, store_evaluation\nimport asyncio\n# import weave\nimport traceback\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom boto3.dynamodb.conditions import Key\nimport argparse\nimport boto3\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\n\"\"\"\nRecommended Design Task Prompts:\n\ndesign_task_context = '''\nHere are the current suggestions and insights we have collected: \n{suggestions}\n\nFor each suggestion that does not have a design specification yet, create a detailed technical design that includes:\n\n1.

If not, output \"Video does not exist\" and skip all future steps.\n\n1. Verify the quality of the video. Output how many seconds are in the video and if any frames or information is missing. If information is missing, output \"Video frames have issues\" and skip all future steps.\n\n2.

Include the exact times they spend on each task and the details of the exact information they look at. Do not hallucinate. Report exactly what happens.\n\n3. Explain likely User Intent and Goals: Describe what the user aims to achieve at each step and if they feel able to do so.\n\n4. Reactions and Emotions: Describe how their mouse movements or navigation correlate to their emotional state and expressions: moments of confusion, frustration, satisfaction, or delight.\n\n5. Feature Interpretation: Describe how their mouse movements or navigation correlate to their perception and interpretation of each feature or option, including any misunderstandings.\n\n6. Thought Process: Capture insights into the user's assumptions, needs, or internal reasoning as they navigate.\n\n7. Usability: Based on the user's perspective, summarize overall usability, including what they find intuitive or challenging.\n\n8. List the main insights, patterns, and takeaways from the recording.

The reach fraction is calc(0.3032*100)% (\\u224830.32%), indicating that nearly one-third of total sessions engage with the CTA. Notably, the CTA element on the order fulfillment page at url 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/order-fulfillment' with xpath '/html/body/div[3]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]' shows significantly lower engagement compared to our overall metrics, highlighting a potential design or placement flaw.\\n\\n## Problem Statement\\nThe CTA engagement is underperforming relative to the uplift target. With a current average of 176.29 interactions versus a goal of 220.36, and given that 208 unique sessions are recording CTA activity, there is a clear indication that the design or positioning of the CTA element on the order fulfillment page might be causing a tracking or engagement issue.\\n\\n## Business Objective\\nIncrease user engagement and conversion rates by optimizing the design and placement of key CTA elements, thereby raising the average CTA interactions and overall site performance.\\n\\n## Hypothesis\\nBy redesigning or repositioning the underperforming CTA element on the order fulfillment page, we expect to achieve the 25% uplift target \\u2013 increasing average interactions from 176.29 to 220.36 per day \\u2013 and enhance the reach fraction, ultimately improving user engagement metrics.\\n\\n## Metrics\\n- Frequency: 208\\n- Severity: 7\\n- Severity reasoning: The severity score is set at 7 because the CTA element on the order fulfillment page is underperforming despite 208 unique sessions showing engagement. With a current average of 176.29 interactions and a target of 220.36, the design anomaly poses a significant risk to conversion rates, suggesting that misalignment in design or placement could lead to substantial performance losses.\\n- Confidence: 0.85\\n- Confidence reasoning: We assign a confidence score of 0.85 based on robust data derivations. The metrics \\u2013 current average CTA interactions of 176.29, a target of 220.36 after applying a 25% uplift, and a reach fraction of 0.3032 \\u2013 are directly computed from detailed SQL queries executed over complete weekly data. These traceable computations reinforce the reliability of this insight.\\n\", \"okr_name\": \"Enhance CTA Element Visibility on Heatmaps\", \"timestamp\": \"1739734352545\", \"suggestion_count\": 0}, {\"markdown\": \"# Insight Analysis\\n\\n## Data Statement\\nOur segmentation analysis over the past 7 days shows that the conversion funnel on key conversion pages ('https://redstagfulfillment.com/contact-us' and 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/get-pricing') is failing across all device types. When segmented by device, Desktop (device_form 0) had 499 sessions with 0.0% conversions (target of 25), Tablet (device_form 1) had 5 sessions with 0.0% conversions (target 0), and Mobile (device_form 2) had 182 sessions with 0.0% conversions (target 9). The overall weighted conversion rate is 0.0% and the sum of target conversions is 34. The primary conversion element is configured with numeric ID 1 for both its URL and XPath.\\n\\n## Problem Statement\\nFrom a total of 686 sessions on the conversion pages, zero conversions were recorded across all device segments. This is reflected as a weighted conversion rate of 0.0% versus a combined target of 34 conversions, indicating a major breakdown in the conversion funnel. These findings suggest issues in user engagement, suboptimal CTA design, or possible tracking misconfigurations.\\n\\n## Business Objective\\nImprove conversion performance on key form pages by optimizing CTA design and user experience tailored by device, with the goal of moving conversion metrics closer to industry benchmarks.\\n\\n## Hypothesis\\nBy redesigning page layouts and enhancing the visibility and responsiveness of primary conversion elements (which are mapped to numeric IDs 1 for both URL and XPath) on Desktop and Mobile, we expect conversion rates to improve. Achieving a combined target of 34 conversions (based on a 5% benchmark) would indicate significant gains in user engagement.\\n\\n## Metrics\\n- Frequency: 686\\n- Severity: 5\\n- Severity reasoning: Zero conversions among 686 sessions represent a critical failure in the conversion funnel, leading to a substantial missed opportunity for lead generation.\\n- Confidence: 0.9\\n- Confidence reasoning: This insight is underpinned by robust segmentation SQL queries that isolate sessions by device type and accurately calculate conversion metrics.

For Mobile, the button registers calc(150) interactions against a target of calc(187.5) (reach: calc(0.30*100)%). For Tablet, current interactions are calc(100) versus a target of calc(125) (reach: calc(0.30*100)%).\\n\\n## Problem Statement\\nThe segmentation data indicates a consistent shortfall in interactions across all devices on critical conversion pages. Specifically, even though the Desktop segment shows a relatively higher engagement, Mobile and Tablet segments are underperforming, suggesting that the design or placement of the primary form buttons on 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/get-pricing/' and 'https://redstagfulfillment.com/contact-us/' may require optimization to improve overall conversion rates.\\n\\n## Business Objective\\nIncrease on-site CTR and form fill conversion rates by optimizing the design and placement of key conversion elements, specifically the primary form buttons on 'get-pricing' and 'contact-us' pages, across all device segments.\\n\\n## Hypothesis\\nBy redesigning and repositioning the primary form buttons, we expect to narrow the gap between current and target interactions in the Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet segments, thereby enhancing overall conversion performance.\\n\\n## Metrics\\n- Frequency: 450\\n- Severity: 5\\n- Severity reasoning: A severity score of 5 is warranted as the deficits are substantial: Desktop is 50 interactions short, Mobile is 37.5 short, and Tablet is 25 short relative to their targets. This considerable shortfall on high-impact conversion elements can lead to significant lost conversion opportunities if not addressed.\\n- Confidence: 0.85\\n- Confidence reasoning: Our confidence score of 0.85 comes from the clear, device-specific segmentation metrics, derived from fixed, validated values.

Estimated segmentation indicates 142 returning sessions and 1 new session. Based on these fixed values, the current conversion count (okr_current) is 0 and the target conversion count (okr_goal), calculated as 5% of reach, is approximately 0.3. Thus, the computed reach fraction (conversions/reach) is 0.00%.\\n\\n## Problem Statement\\nAlthough the Get Pricing page shows measurable engagement\\u2014with an average dwell time of 352.07 seconds and a scroll depth of 508.14 units\\u2014and a robust returning user segment (estimated 142 returning vs. 1 new), there are zero recorded conversion events. The Get Pricing button, identified by its xpath '//button[@id=\\\"get-pricing-btn\\\"]', fails to convert any session out of the 6 total.
